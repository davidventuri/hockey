<p>Compared to the much-anticipated 2013 NHL draft class -- a group that featured projected elite talents like <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041969/nathan-mackinnon">Nathan MacKinnon</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041992/seth-jones">Seth Jones</a> -- this year's prospect pool has been flying a little under the radar. But when you start to put the 2014 crop under the microscope, it's clear that there is still plenty of talent to be harvested.</p>

<div class="mod-content">
<h4>Prospect ranking methodology</h4>
<p>Rankings are based on discussions with scouts on top of video and live viewings, and place a slight emphasis on puck possession, based on studies that show it is the <a href="http://vhockey.blogspot.com/2009/05/possession-is-everything.html" target="new">best predictive measure</a> of team-level success. Performance is a secondary factor, adjusted for age, team strength, league quality and other contextual elements.</p> 
<p>Defensemen are given slightly less value than forwards of equal skill level because of higher projection uncertainty inherent in the position. </p> 
</div>
</div>
<!-- END INLINE MODULE --><!-- end inline 1 --></p>
<p>To put it in perspective, compared to last year's draft class (without our current hindsight), I'd have ranked <strong>Aaron Ekblad</strong> behind MacKinnon and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041971/jonathan-drouin">Jonathan Drouin</a>, with a tough debate about how close he was to Jones and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3042003/valeri-nichushkin">Valeri Nichushkin</a>. He'd have ranked ahead of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041970/aleksander-barkov">Aleksander Barkov</a>, however. I'd then have <strong>Sam Bennett</strong> and the rest of the top tier after Barkov.</p>
<p>Although the No. 1 and 2 prospects are below average compared to the players who have fallen in that range historically, the middle of the top end -- the Nos. 5 to 10 range -- is somewhat <em>above&nbsp;</em>average. This draft may not be one that produces superstars, but there are some very useful players here.</p>
<p>There is a slight drop-off after Ekblad, and the next tier runs three prospects deep, with another tier from Nos. 5 to 9. There's a good argument to fit any of the next seven prospects after the No. 9 slot into that group, but the rest of the draft is a gradual decline from there.</p>
<p>The OHL is represented well, with 10 players in the top 30. This is also a strong year for European leagues, particularly the Swedish ones, as for the first time those leagues emerged as the preferred alternative for top non-Swedish prospects overseas. <strong>Kevin Fiala</strong> (Switzerland) as well as <strong>David Pastrnak</strong> and <strong>Jakub Vrana</strong> (Czech Republic) played in Sweden's top leagues and developed well.</p>
<p>It's also a comparatively strong class in terms of netminders, led by <strong>Thatcher Demko</strong>. However, this is a poor year for defensemen. After my No. 1 overall prospect, Ekblad, it's a big drop to <strong>Haydn Fleury</strong> (No. 10), and on the whole, there are only four defensemen in my top 30 skaters.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this is a personal ranking, and I am aware it does not necessarily reflect an industry consensus. For example, it is likely that both <strong>Leon Draisaitl</strong> (No. 7) and <strong>Michael Dal Colle</strong> (No. 8) go in the top five June 27.</p>
<p>With the stage now set, here's how the top 100 prospects stack up, with specific ranking explanations for the prospects in that top nine-man group:</p><p></p>

<p><b>1. Aaron Ekblad | D | Barrie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 2/7/96 | 2013-14 stats: 58 GP, 23 G, 30 A, 91 PIM</b></p>
<p>The second player tagged with "Exceptional" status in the OHL -- between <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5160/john-tavares">John Tavares</a> and Connor McDavid -- Ekblad is the top player in the 2014 draft class. He's a monster on the back end at 6-foot-4, 216 pounds, and plays the game with an edge. Some may point to his size as the reason Ekblad dominates, but he does so much more than just hit and win battles: he skates well with good power in his stride and excellent pivots; he has really developed the offensive side of his game, with above-average puck skills and great coordination for a big man; he sees the ice well, can be creative along the point and join the attack on top of having a high-end shot from deep. Ekblad doesn't have any outstanding skills in particular, and he can still make an odd mistake, but the total package of what he brings to the table is unique, especially considering he's a blueliner. He's a potential star defenseman and may have another level to his game if developed properly.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> The reason for my choice at No. 1 is two-fold: Ekblad is a superior talent to Bennett, and though he has risks, they were not enough to keep him from losing the top spot. It's rare that we encounter a big, strong defender like Ekblad with the natural hockey skills he has. You add to that his high-end to elite hockey IQ in both ends of the rink, and a huge shot, and the total package looks like a player who has an NHL All-Star floor, and the ceiling of an elite NHL defenseman. Bennett is strong in a lot of areas, but not elite in any one of them. It is not as though we are debating an elite defenseman prospect versus a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5037/steven-stamkos">Steven Stamkos</a> or Tavares type at No. 1. Although defensemen are notably more difficult to project -- and bust more often -- he's certainly worth it compared to the other top options in this class.</p>
<p><b>2. Sam Bennett | C | Kingston (OHL)<br>
DOB: 6/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 57 GP, 36 G, 55 A, 118 PIM</b></p>
<p>It's hard to find a specific part of Bennett's game that is weak; he's simply a fantastic all-around forward. He's a really fast and energetic skater who can play at a high pace and embrace a pressure style with high amounts of effectiveness. However, Bennett's best quality is his hockey IQ. He sees the ice really well, and can dominate the puck in terms of possession due to his hockey brain on top of his speed and puck skills. Bennett has flashy elements to his game, while also being able to generate chances through work ethic and instincts, and has an impressive shot as well. Bennett battles well for pucks, with what one NHL exec coins "superb natural balance" in terms of his center of gravity in board confrontations. He also embraces the physical game, can lay some quality hits and is a fine defensive forward. He could get stronger, improve his positioning a little, and maybe not try to force the tough plays, but for the most part he's the complete package.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Bennett, Sam Reinhart and William Nylander were in the same tier for much of the season, with Bennett pushing ahead in the past few months. As opposed to the much more complex explanation of Ekblad versus Bennett, this one is more straightforward. While Nylander is a much better puck handler, with better vision and hockey IQ, Bennett has the positional edge and is a better skater than Nylander, with more defensive value as well. Bennett carries notably less risk in my eyes, with a marginally lower ceiling.</p>
<p><b>3. William Nylander | RW | Modo (SHL)<br>
DOB: 5/1/96 | 2013-14 stats: 22 GP, 1 G, 6 A, 6 PIM</b></p>
<p>The son of longtime NHLer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/686/michael-nylander">Michael Nylander</a> may be the most gifted pure offensive talent in the draft. William had a so-so first half when he struggled to find a role, but had a tremendous second half. Because of that turnaround, I've heard NHL scouts rank him anywhere from No. 2 overall to the 20s. He was over a point per game pace with Sodertalje in the SHL-2, setting a season record for points by an under-18 player, and played around 20 minutes per game with Modo down the stretch. Nylander's pucks skills are elite, as he can be described as "an artist" by some scouts in terms of how well he controls the puck, and the unique plays he makes. Nylander's hockey sense is fantastic as well, in terms of his vision, and offensive intellect. You combine that with a pretty good top gear and Nylander can create all sorts of havoc offensively. Nylander can deke a defender out, make a highlight-reel pass, speed by players. He's not the biggest guy (5-11, 181 pounds), his defensive play needs work, and he can try to do too much sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Nylander has a better skill level than Reinhart, but Reinhart is better physically, and <em>worlds</em> better defensively. Nylander has more upside than Reinhart, but carries more risk in terms of his all-around game. Reinhart's probably a better player right now, but Nylander is in his 17-year-old season (as compared to Reinhart being in his 18-year-old season) and Nylander seems to have more room to grow. For the latter reason, being that I think he has so much upside, and it's easier to close the gap defensively than offensively for an under-20 player, I give the edge to Nylander.</p>

<p><b>4. Sam Reinhart | C | Kootenay (WHL)<br>
DOB: 11/6/95 | 2013-14 stats: 60 GP, 36 G, 69 A, 11 PIM</b></p>
<p>The best of the three Reinhart brothers -- <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2976832/griffin-reinhart">Griffin Reinhart</a> is with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/nyi/new-york-islanders">New York Islanders</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5585/max-reinhart">Max Reinhart</a> is with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/cgy/calgary-flames">Calgary Flames</a> -- is a dynamic right-handed center, and is the best pure passer in the draft class. His ability to dictate tempo elevates his game to a distinct level. Reinhart can make all kinds of plays with the puck, and his elite hockey sense stands out regularly in terms of the passing lanes he sees that even an observer with a bird's-eye view may not spot. He has great hands and can make a lot of plays when he goes one-on-one against a defenseman. He has average size (6-1, 183 pounds), but will work hard in battles and can play an average physical game, although I have heard some scouts criticize him in that area. One of the skills that distinguishes Reinhart is his smart play in the defensive zone, shutting down top players and possessing top-quality abilities on the penalty kill.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> There was a bit of a drop-off at this point, so the decision wasn't too hard to put Reinhart over Ehlers. Ehlers is a much better skater, and may be slightly more skilled. That isn't enough to balance out the fact that Reinhart thinks and sees the game at a much higher level, with substantially better defense. He is also bigger, and is a right-handed center who plays the position well.</p>
<p><b>5. Nikolaj Ehlers | LW | Halifax (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 2/14/96 | 2013-14 stats: 63 GP, 49 G, 55 A, 51 PIM</b></p>
<p>The Danish Ehlers landed in North America with a bang, scoring well over a point-per-game pace in his rookie QMJHL season. He's an electrifying offensive talent who stands out on a regular basis. His skating is easily plus -- especially his top gear -- as he turns defenders regularly. Ehlers generates speed so easily with his first few steps and has a clean, easy stride. He complements that with a large arsenal of stick-handling moves. One scout notes that Ehlers doesn't just ooze skill, but he can make all the tough skill plays at a high tempo. He sees the ice pretty well, and can make the really difficult passes. He's got an above-average shot, with smooth technique on his snap, and the puck explodes quickly off his tape. Ehlers isn't the biggest guy (6-0, 163 pounds) or the most physical, although he battles well. His pure scoring potential is what gets him in the conversation here.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Ehlers and Kevin Fiala are pretty similar players. Both are small, dynamic offensive wingers who had big breakout seasons to become elite prospects. Ehlers is a much better skater, while Fiala has better puck-possession tools. They're both around the same in terms of developing their physical game and play off the puck. I lean to Ehlers in this slot due to the fact I've been more impressed in quantity of viewings I've had of him and notes I've gotten from scouts, but it's a coin-flip call.</p>
<p><b>6. Kevin Fiala | LW | HV71 (SHL)<br>
DOB: 7/22/96 | 2013-14 stats: 17 GP, 3 G, 8 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>The next great Swiss prospect, Fiala really started to turn heads from about December on. He had a strong World Junior Championship and under-18 World Championship, started playing top-six minutes in the SHL, putting up a ton of points in the process. In terms of points per game, he had the second-highest rate in the SHL among under-18 players in modern history, behind <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/284/peter-forsberg">Peter Forsberg</a>. He can make highlight-reel plays with the puck, and he's also a really good passer with great hockey IQ, and doesn't seem to turn the puck over. On the power play, Fiala is the kind of player you want controlling the puck and starting the puck movement. He's 5-11, and while that isn't ideal, he does battle hard and has a lot of drive to his game. Fiala needs to improve his defensive positioning.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Fiala is a better if not <em>much</em> better skater than Draisaitl, with better pure skill and hands. They're close in terms of hockey sense and vision, with Draisaitl having a massive advantage in terms of size and physical game. All decisions within a tier are tough, but what made me lean toward Fiala is how he differentiated himself: He looks unique on the ice and had a unique season. That stands out to me since one of the main purposes of the draft for teams is obtaining stars as opposed to good/very good players who can be more easily gained through free agency. I'm not saying Leon can't be the former -- he very well could be -- but Fiala looks like that possibility is greater for him, even if he carries more risk. Draisaitl looks like a standard top-end 18-year-old prospect.</p>
<p><b>7. Leon Draisaitl | C | Prince Albert (WHL)<br>
DOB: 10/27/95 | 2013-14 stats: 64 GP, 38 G, 67 A, 24 PIM</b></p>
<p>Leon is one of the best -- if not <em>the </em>best -- NHL prospects to come out of Germany as a first-time draft-eligible player. He measures in at 6-1 and 209 pounds, with the ability to protect the puck at a high level. Draisaitl shows a good strength level and competitiveness in battles. His hockey sense is also exceptional as he processes the game at a really quick tempo. This translates to his best offensive quality: his vision. Draisaitl's quick passing skills, knowledge of how to make defenders move to open lanes, and the creativity he shows as a playmaker are unique, and make him a dangerous player from inside the offensive blue line. He's also got some flash to his game, and his defense is solid. When he gets going, his speed is average but his first few steps are a bit sluggish and his stride isn't the cleanest.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Dal Colle doesn't have the standout skill of Nylander, Fiala or Ehlers, or the well-rounded game of Reinhart. He's just a very talented offensive player but not elite, and a player who needs to work on his off-puck game. However, like most of the players in this top tier, I see a reasonable case to move him mostly anywhere in the top range. He's a better skater than Draisaitl with the same amount of skill, and a better shot, but I like Leon's sense and physical game more, which is enough to edge him ahead.</p>
<p><b>8. Michael Dal Colle | LW | Oshawa (OHL)<br>
DOB: 6/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 69 GP, 39 G, 56 A, 34 PIM</b></p>
<p>"Puck possessor" is the common word thrown around when scouts discuss Dal Colle. "He makes all the right plays, he's very patient, he sees the ice well, and his team always has the puck when he's out there," said one NHL head scout. Dal Colle's puck skills and instincts make him a force when he's on the ice, but what makes him a top-end prospect is the size he brings to the table (6-2, 172 pounds), on top of the fantastic skill components. He also possesses a high-end shot. In terms of pure offensive potential and skills, he's right in the same category as Reinhart and Bennett. I have heard from some scouts who like his skating, although I see him as more average in that regard. He'll have some good moments in the defensive zone, but could stand to work on his positioning. He could also stand to be less bashful in corner play.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Kapanen is a much better skater than Dal Colle, but I find Dal Colle to be more skilled, and Dal Colle is also a bigger player. In addition, I have fewer questions in terms of production about Dal Colle, and combined with a slightly better skill set that makes me lean to him in this spot.</p>
<p><b>9. Kasperi Kapanen | RW | KalPa (Liiga)<br>
DOB: 7/23/96| 2013-14 stats: 47 GP, 7 G, 7 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>The son of longtime NHLer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/431/sami-kapanen">Sami Kapanen</a> is a dynamic offensive player. He was a top player at the under-18 championships as an under-age level player, and would have played a top-six role for Finland at the WJC had he not been injured. His production in Finland's top league was not great, but keep in mind that his team was historically bad this season. Kapanen is a very good skater with a blistering first few steps and an above-average top gear. He sees the ice at a high-end level, and regularly makes all kinds of impressive passes. His ability to generate through his own skills and to set up others is what puts him here. Kapanen also has a good shot, and works hard in battles. He needs to work on his defense, and is undersized (6-0, 181 pounds) but is pretty strong.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Given the type of player Kapanen is -- a high-end skater with great skill, hockey IQ, finishing ability and intangibles -- he projects as a potential top-line forward. Fleury is a big, mobile defender, with fine defensive skills, and has a similar top-end type of projection as Kapanen. Given the similarities, the tie goes to the forward, due to less projection risk.</p>
<p><b>10. Haydn Fleury | D | Red Deer (WHL)<br>
DOB: 7/8/96 | 2013-14 stats: 70 GP, 8 G, 38 A, 46 PIM</b></p>
<p>Fleury is one of the two defenders in this class with legitimate top-pairing upside. He is a 6-3, 200-pound defender who plays the body frequently, and does it well; he projects as a high-end physical player at the top level if he continues to grow into his body. He's also very mobile in every direction, he's got a great top speed to rush the puck, and he's agile with his turns/pivots and tight space maneuvering. Fleury also has the ability to QB a power play. His main drawback is his hockey sense, as he can be an overly risky player who can try to do too much, and make costly turnovers. He has some good stretches defensively, coupled with some stretches that make you hide your eyes. He could be a potential two-way horse in the NHL if he fully pans out.</p>
<p><b>11. Jake Virtanen | RW | Calgary (WHL)<br>
DOB: 8/17/96 | 2013-14 stats: 71 GP, 45 G, 26 A, 100 PIM</b></p>
<p>Virtanen is an all-engines-go type of player who put up a ton of goals in his second WHL season. His best attribute is his skating, and he may be the best skater in this draft class. "He has that second gear to blow by defenders that other players don't have," said one scout. Virtanen's ability to gain the zone is very desirable and he's a player you want with the puck in transition because of his speed and impressive puck skills. He forechecks well, hustles to get his defensive assignments and plays hard on the penalty kill. Virtanen shot is plus, as he gets it off quick, with torque and accuracy. He won't be a team's primary puck carrier or scoring-chance creator, but there's budding upside with Virtanen on that front if he continues to develop well.</p>
<p><strong>12. Sonny Milano | LW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 58 GP, 29 G, 57 A, 23 PIM</strong></p>
<p>Milano put up giant scoring numbers with the USNTDP compared to even what most top forwards have done in the past. Some of it was due to playing on a line with elite 2015 draft prospect Jack Eichel, but he was not a passenger on that train. When you watch Milano, "soft hands" and "offensive instincts" are the things that stand out immediately, and what I heard scouts say about him. His puck skills and offensive hockey sense are among the best in the draft. He's not selfish with the puck, as he sees the ice and distributes at a high level. Milano is also a good if not an excellent skater with high-end acceleration. His defense is not amazing, but he's improved significantly in that area, even taking on some PK duty for the NTDP. His most notable weaknesses are his size (5-11, 185 pounds) and strength, and he can turn the puck over a little too much with his flashy plays. He is committed to Boston College for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>13. Jakub Vrana | RW | Linkoping (SHL)<br>
DOB: 2/28/96 | 2013-14 stats: 24 GP, 2 G, 1 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>This is a pretty high ranking, but it's slightly lower than I expected I'd end up slotting Vrana earlier this season, as he looked like one of the greatest Czech prospects in recent memory. He's one of the few Czech players to ever play as an under-age player for their under-18 and under-20 teams, alongside <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3802/michael-frolik">Michael Frolik</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2120/jiri-hudler">Jiri Hudler</a>. There's a reasonable best-case scenario with Vrana that he'll become a top-end winger and I'll end up cringing looking back at ranking him too low. Vrana is a shifty player, with very good speed and a nice first few steps. His defense could use work. He also can try to do too much and be selfish at times. The most troubling thing with Vrana is that his development seems to be flattening out, and a downward trend is always a red flag, so there's also a non-zero chance that he busts.</p>
<p><b>14. Brendan Perlini | LW | Niagara (OHL)<br>
DOB: 4/27/96 | 2013-14 stats: 58 GP, 34 G, 37 A, 36 PIM</b></p>
<p>Perlini showed immense improvements from his 16-year-old season to this one, and emerged as one of the top first-time draft-eligible forwards. A Great Britain native, Perlini has probably the best size-to-skating ratio in the draft. He's a 6-3, 200-pound winger and gets up the ice at an elite level; Perlini's first-step quickness for his size is extremely impressive. His physical package and skill level make him a very desirable power forward-type of prospect if he improves in the physical part of the game. Perlini has quick hands and the offensive composure to make plays in tight spaces. He's also a great scorer who can finish from mid-distance. Perlini has the ability to be a game-breaker, and while he still needs to find that consistency in terms of creation and two-way play, he can be a major factor in a game.</p>
<p><strong>15. Robby Fabbri | C | Guelph (OHL)<br>
DOB: 1/22/96 | 2013-14 stats: 58 GP, 45 G, 42 A, 55 PIM</strong></p>
<p>Fabbri put up a lot of points on a very gifted OHL team, but then again, he was a big part of why they scored so many goals. Fabbri is an above-average skater who has good natural speed, but with his great work ethic he's a player who jets up and down the ice. Fabbri gets on defensemen quickly, and his skating makes him a dangerous short-handed goal threat on the penalty kill. Fabbri sees his options well, understands where to be and what plays to make to generate scoring chances. He's got an accurate shot, although it could use more zip. He's not the biggest guy (5-10, 166 pounds), and that's his biggest weakness, if not his only real notable issue. Fabbri does battle really well, however, and will initiate contact, which is an element you want to see in the smaller players.</p>
<p><b>16. David Pastrnak | RW | Sodertalje (Allsvenskan)<br>
DOB: 5/25/96| 2013-14 stats: 36 GP, 8 G, 16 A, 24 PIM</b></p>
<p>Pastrnak had one of the most productive seasons in the lower Swedish league for an under-18 forward in decades, despite a late back injury that kept him out of the under-18 championships. His 24 points in 36 games surpassed <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2968772/filip-forsberg">Filip Forsberg</a>'s 17 points when the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/nsh/nashville-predators">Nashville Predators</a> prospect was in this situation. Pastrnak is a smooth, coordinated puck handler who can make the tough evasive moves on a frequent basis. His hockey IQ is really high, as he sees all his options, processes the game very quickly and understands how to play with pace. He's a good skater with shiftiness and an above-average top gear, who also possesses a quick release on his shot. Pastrnak's main weakness is his physical game, as he loses a fair amount of battles.</p>
<p><b>17. Ivan Barbashev | C | Moncton (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 12/14/95 | 2013-14 stats: 48 GP, 25 G, 43 A, 27 PIM</b></p>
<p>Barbashev has been on the prospect radar for several years. He was a top scorer at last year's under-18 championships, was the top overall pick in the CHL Import Draft and received a lot of praise from Russian scouts before he transferred. He's the kind of player who can be set up on the point on a power play, due to the way he can control the puck and see all the options. What makes Barbashev dangerous at even strength is his skill level, but also his intangibles. He's a very hard worker who is plays with a physical edge and can land some crushing blows. He's committed defensively with fine skills on the penalty kill. He needs to get stronger and be a little more consistent offensively, but there aren't a ton of nits to pick with Barbashev.</p>

DOB: 12/5/95 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 39 G, 35 A, 136 PIM</b></p>
<p>Prior to this season, Ritchie struggled with injuries and consistency, but he got on more of a solid footing in 2013-14. His toolkit is tremendous, and at his best he can be dominant. Ritchie's physical game is fantastic. He's 6-3, 235 pounds and aggressive. Ritchie attacks defenders, and is great protecting the puck. It will obviously be harder on him in the pro game, but it was near-impossible to get the puck off of him at the junior level. Ritchie's strength level is great, and I've seen bulldoze through people on the way to the net, and shoulder off multiple checks without much effort. He's got a good skill level, too. Ritchie's shot is of the high-end variety with a lot of weight behind his snaps. His defense needs some work, and he has a tendency to disappear at times (which is difficult for such a large player).</p>
<p><b>19. Jared McCann | C | Sault Ste. Marie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 5/3/96 | 2013-14 stats: 64 GP, 27 G, 35 A, 51 PIM</b></p>
<p>McCann is a gifted all-around player, and has a strong hockey IQ. His hockey sense translates to plus creativity, vision, positioning and defensive awareness. He regularly lined up against the opponents' best players in tough even-strength minutes, and was effective in doing so. He's an above-average stick handler who won't try to be a hero, but can make tough plays to evade pressure and create chances. He'll also pull off the occasional highlight-reel play. His best offensive asset in the attacking zone is his shot. He's got a bullet, and can score from a distance -- and at times, overshoot. McCann certainly needs to get stronger, and despite a good physical work ethic he projects as a below-average physical player at the top level.</p>
<p><b>20. Josh Ho-Sang | RW | Windsor (OHL)<br>
DOB: 1/22/96 | 2013-14 stats: 67 GP, 32 G, 53 A, 44 PIM</b></p>
<p>Ho-Sang is one of the toughest players to evaluate in this draft. On raw talent, he's a clear top-10 prospect and maybe even in the top five. Scouts can't praise his skill level enough. He's one of the best skaters in the draft; his first few steps and overall stride are high end, and his top speed is elite. Ho-Sang is also a high-end if not better puck handler. This combination allows him to be a dynamic player who can create scoring chances out of nothing. However, Ho-Sang can struggle at times with his decision making with the puck, frequently turning it over or trying to do too much. Off the puck, he's a work in progress. He has top-line tools, but more risk than the rest of the top tier of prospects.</p>
<p><b>21. Alex Tuch | RW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/10/96 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 29 G, 35 A, 70 PIM</b></p>
<p>Tuch really elevated his game as a prospect this season, improving significantly in several areas while playing on the top line for the NTDP alongside Eichel and Milano. He's a giant at 6-4, 215 pounds, with a lot of skill. He's highly creative, and is at his best from the hashmarks in. Tuch protects the puck quite well and can be very effective in the cycle. He won't bulldoze guys, but is pretty physical and due to his size/strength wins a lot of battles. Tuch's skating has gotten better, but still has room for improvement. He also needs to improve his defensive positioning and awareness.</p>
<p><b>22. Adrian Kempe | LW | Modo (SHL)<br>
DOB: 9/13/96 | 2013-14 stats: 45 GP, 5 G, 6 A, 12 PIM</b></p>
<p>Kempe is a great power winger who showed flashes in the SHL this season on top of quality under-18 showings. He's one of the better skaters available, with the first-few-step acceleration and overall top gear to simply fly through the neutral zone and pressure defenders. When you combine Kempe's speed with a strong frame and a willingness to attack the net, he becomes a dangerous physical threat. His hand-eye coordination allows him to control the puck well and be dangerous getting his stick on pucks in front of the net. Kempe can play center somewhat effectively, in addition to his natural wing slot. He needs to improve his pace and reads, as he can get a little lost in the play at times.</p>
<p><b>23. Roland McKeown | D | Kingston (OHL)<br>
DOB: 1/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 62 GP, 11 G, 32 A, 61 PIM</b></p>
<p>McKeown was one of the top rookies in the OHL as a 16-year-old, and followed it up with a very good 17-year-old season, including a defenseman of the year nomination. His best skill is his skating, as McKeown is one of the better skaters available in the class. Regularly, you see him get closer to the play than most defenders would, because he has the ability to recover easily. His pivots and backwards speed are all impressive as well. McKeown outlets the puck very well and while he may not make a highlight-reel rush he can execute pretty difficult passes. His defensive game has grown a ton over the past 12 months, so much that he has earned tough minutes responsibilities in Kingston. He be a little too aggressive with his decision making at times, but mostly he tends to make the right calls. He needs to be a little tougher on his checks.</p>
<p><b>24. Nikita Scherbak | RW | Saskatoon (WHL)<br>
DOB: 12/30/95 | 2013-14 stats: 54 GP, 26 G, 43 A, 28 PIM</b></p>
<p>Scherbak was a huge riser this season. He was a relative unknown on the draft radar in the summer, but had a huge 18-year-old rookie season in the WHL. He's a really interesting player because he has so many tools and the character to keep improving and learning about the North American game. His vision creates a lot, but he just understands where to go, what to do, and how to make all the right plays at a high speed to create offense. "His sense of timing is great," said one scout. His stride is pretty clean and can show a good bursts of speed, although I'm not sure he's a blazer. I think with improved strength, his skating has notable room to grow and excel. His defense isn't the best, but it isn't a major issue.</p>
<p><b>25. Brayden Point | C | Moose Jaw (WHL)<br>
DOB: 3/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 36 G, 55 A, 53 PIM</b></p>
<p>Point led Moose Jaw in scoring this season, after a great 16-year-old campaign in 2012-13 when he was second in team scoring. Point is a high-pace player who brings speed and intensity to every shift. I've heard scouts grade him as an above-average skater, with the odd one qualifying him as high end in that area. He's a player who plays bigger than his size (5-9, 161 pounds), with unusually good physical and defensive value for a smaller player. Point has above-average puck skills and vision, and can show some pretty significant moments in the skill area. He also is a pretty good shooter. Point's major flaw is his size, and I'm not sure if he has enough skill to be a big-time scorer in light of that. However, I have enough confidence in his all-around game and the talent he has displayed to rank him at this level.</p>
<p><b>26. Dylan Larkin | C | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 7/30/96| 2013-14 stats: 60 GP, 31 G, 25 A, 56 PIM</b></p>
<p>Larkin is one of the top power forwards available in this year's draft class, and is an outstanding skater, one of the best in the class. He has a fine but not outstanding amount of skill, but gains the offensive zone very often due to his skating ability. Larkin has average size (6-0, 192 pounds), but he's pretty strong on the puck and has a fantastic on-ice work ethic. He drives the net, muscles out opponents in battles and gets back on defense effectively. He kills penalties well and he can be a shorthanded scoring threat. Another plus: Larkin plays both wing and center effectively. He's committed to the University of Michigan for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>27. Conner Bleackley | C | Red Deer (WHL)<br>
DOB: 7/2/96| 2013-14 stats: 71 GP, 29 G, 39 A, 48 PIM</b></p>
<p>Bleackley trended up this season in a significant way, and developed into a legitimate two-way forward for Red Deer. He logged big minutes in all situations, which is the kind of player he projects to being as a pro. He's a very hard-working forward who "competes so hard in every area of the ice, every shift," per one scout. Bleackley kills penalties effectively, and anticipates the flow of the offensive pressure well. He's also a very astute thinker on the offensive side of the puck. Bleackley has a fine strength level right now, but certainly has more room to grow on that front. His skating is decent, however.</p>
<p><b>28. Nikolai Goldobin | RW | Sarnia (OHL)<br>
DOB: 10/7/95| 2013-14 stats: 67 GP, 38 G, 56 A, 21 PIM</b></p>
<p>Goldobin was one of the top scorers in the OHL in his second season in the league; his pure offensive skill package is outstanding, one of the best in the class. He's a gifted playmaker, which allows him to be the primary creator on the power play from the side wall. Goldobin sees his options quickly, and delivers all his passes on the tape even if he has to elevate the puck. He projects as a fantastic power-play asset at the NHL level. At the risk of furthering a stereotype about Russian forwards, Goldobin's main issues are off the puck. He needs to win more battles, gain strength and improve his defense.</p>
<p><b>29. Julius Honka | D | Swift Current (WHL)<br>
DOB: 12/3/95 | 2013-14 stats: 62 GP, 16 G, 40 A, 52 PIM</b></p>
<p>Honka hit the ground running in his first season in North America, looking substantially better as a prospect than when he played in Europe. The factor that's really elevated his play has been his improvement defensively, which has allowed him to be leaned on more in tough minutes (and will be pivotal to his having a big role in the NHL). His physical game remains a major liability, as he's small (5-11, 174 pounds), not that strong, and not an intimidating guy when contact is initiated. Overall, he can play a risky style of game, but most of the time he doesn't get caught and knows how to make the most of his offensive gifts without giving up too much on the back end.</p>
<p><b>30. Nick Schmaltz | C | Green Bay (USHL)<br>
DOB: 2/23/96 | 2013-14 stats: 55 GP, 18 G, 45 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>Schmaltz has been a top scorer in the USHL for the past two seasons, and is the younger brother of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-blues">St. Louis Blues</a> prospect <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2976853/jordan-schmaltz">Jordan Schmaltz</a>. Nick's puck skills and pure creativity allow him to make a lot of defenders miss, and create scoring chances at times when it doesn't look like there is an opportunity. Schmaltz has pretty good possession skills as well. "He can own the puck during a game," said one NHL scout. Schmaltz isn't the biggest guy in the class (6-0, 172 pounds), so he needs to bulk up, and play less bashfully in battles. High risk, high reward is the school of thought among NHL scouts with Schmaltz. He is committed to North Dakota for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>31. Sebastian Aho | D | Skelleftea (SHL)<br>
DOB: 2/17/96 | 2013-14 stats: 21 GP, 1 G, 4 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>Aho had a good draft season, where he worked his way to get a regular shift on one of the top teams in Sweden's top league. His puck-moving skills are exceptional; if you want a patient, aware defender with vision to outlet from the defensive zone or control the power play, Aho is your prospect. Aho skates very well, with a quality stride, excellent footwork on his crossovers and pivots, and the four-way mobility to close in on targets and get up in the attack. Aho has one glaring weakness in that he's undersized at 5-9, 165 pounds. It's why scouts who love what he's shown internationally and in Sweden still have skepticism about whether he can be an NHL player, because it's so tough for small defensemen to get in a lineup. Those concerns are legitimate, but not enough to push aside all the positive qualities about his game.</p>
<p><b>32. Travis Sanheim | D | Calgary (WHL)<br>
DOB: 3/29/96 | 2013-14 stats: 67 GP, 5 G, 24 A, 14 PIM</b></p>
<p>Sanheim wasn't on the radar as a top-100 prospect early in the season, but he really picked up his play in the second half and elevated himself into the conversation. He has effective size (6-3, 181 pounds) and offensive skill, and his puck-moving ability increased as the season progressed. Sanheim has very good mobility with an effortless, powerful stride and the evasiveness you don't typically see with a player his size. His speed allows him to be a threat leading the rush. He isn't an overly physical player, but with his reach and IQ he's able to be strong defensively and makes a fair number of stops.</p>
<p><b>33. Vladislav Kamanev | LW | Magnitogorsk (KHL)<br>
DOB: 8/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 16 GP, 1 G, 0 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>Kamanev was the No. 3 overall pick in the 2013 KHL draft, and played the most KHL games this season among under-18 players. He's a skilled puck handler, but can try to get too fancy sometimes. Unlike the stereotype of skilled Russians, Kamanev plays physical and has some defensive value. He's a 6-2, 200-pound player who can protect the puck quite well, and battles for pucks in his own end. His skating, however, can use some work; he's not slow, but he's about average in that area.</p>
<p><b>34. Spencer Watson | RW | Kingston (OHL)<br>
DOB: 4/25/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 33 G, 35 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>Watson started off the draft season leading the Ivan Hlinka memorial tournament in scoring, and had his second straight productive OHL season. While he's not among the elite talents in his age group, he's a very gifted scorer with a lot of offensive ability. Watson has the ability to make highlight-reel plays due to his creativity with the puck. "[Watson's] one of the more dangerous draft prospects from the offensive zone in," said one NHL executive. He is an above-average passer, and can make impressive plays under pressure and in tight spaces. Watson is a great finisher, who can score from a distance but also understands how to bury the puck when playing in tight. He's small at 5-10, 166 pounds, and is not great defensively or in the skating department.</p>
<p><b>35. Anton Karlsson | LW | Frolunda (J20SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 8/3/96 | 2013-14 stats: 28 GP, 12 G, 10 A, 88 PIM</b></p>
<p>Karlsson is interesting due to all the different ways he can affect a game. He was the sole under-18 player for Sweden at the WJC, has been decent in league play this season, and has been up and down in international showings the past two seasons. Karlsson is an aggressive, agitating forward who pressures well and attacks the net. However, he also has a good skill set. Karlsson is the type of player who can deliver a hit, get a takeaway, and make a skill play afterwards to create a scoring chance. He's also an effective penalty killer. The main criticisms of Karlsson are his consistency and his decisions. His potential is significant, and makes him a desirable prospect.</p>
<p><b>36. Vladimir Tkachev | RW | Moncton (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 10/5/95 | 2013-14 stats: 20 GP, 10 G, 20 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>A high risk, high reward-type of player, Tkachev's offensive hockey mind is one of the best in this draft class, as he can do things with the puck that bring people out of their seats. He processes the game at a good pace and can be a flashy distributor on top of the dazzle he shows with his individual puck skills. Tkachev's understanding of how to make plays under pressure and in tight spaces is a standout element of his game, and it's what allows him to maintain puck control for lengthy periods. He has above-average speed with good agility, although he's not the ideal blazer for a small player. Tkachev's defense isn't great, but it's passable. The physical game is his biggest weakness, which is not surprising given his size (5-8, 163 pounds).</p>
<p><b>37. Anthony DeAngelo | D | Sarnia (OHL)<br>
DOB: 10/24/95 | 2013-14 stats: 51 GP, 15 G, 56 A, 90 PIM</b></p>
<p>DeAngelo is one of the toughest prospects to get a read on in this year's class. His numbers as a 17- and 18-year-old in the OHL have been outstanding, but there are notable question marks on his game from a scouting standpoint. I've heard his skating described by scouts as anywhere from good to great, with my observations leaning to the latter. He can play with pace, and makes creative plays. DeAngelo is not the biggest guy -- at 5-11, 168 pounds -- and while he competes on the ice, he tends to lose his fair share of battles. He has a long way to go defensively. On top of his flaws in the physical game, he often gets beat by skilled players and really needs to work on his angles/positioning. He can also be too risky with the puck, turning it over more than he should.</p>

<p>Audette is the son of longtime NHLer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/31/donald-audette">Donald Audette</a>, and was the first overall pick in the 2012 QMJHL draft. His skill level is great, as he can make plays better than all but a few in this draft class. His high-end vision allows him to make the passes of moderate difficulty look routine, and he can make the high-difficulty ones with good frequency. Audette is a tremendous power-play asset who can be the primary source of chances. Audette's size is his biggest weakness: He's 5-8, 176 pounds, and his physical limitations make his potential NHL even-strength production questionable.</p>
<p><b>39. Eric Cornel | RW | Peterborough (OHL)<br>
DOB: 4/11/96 | 2013-14 stats: 68 GP, 25 G, 37 A, 25 PIM</b></p>
<p>Cornel was the third overall pick in his OHL draft (2012) who underwhelmed as a 16-year-old but took big steps forward in his 17-year-old season. He's a skilled puck-possession forward with top-six upside at the NHL level, if some things go right in his development. He generates scoring chances regularly, as he has high-end offensive instincts, and is poised in possession. As with many skilled prospects, he can try to do too much on the ice, turning the puck over. He works hard, but his off-puck reads and value are underwhelming. Cornel is not the best defensively, needs to bulk up, and isn't the best in the physical game, despite his 6-2, 185-pound frame. He has the ability to overcome that as he develops, but it's a fault right now.</p>
<p><b>40. Joe Hicketts | D | Victoria (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/4/96 | 2013-14 stats: 36 GP, 6 G, 18 A, 12 PIM</b></p>
<p>Hicketts is short (5-8), and missed a large chunk of this season due to injury. Excited yet? Well, here's all the good news about him: He's an exceptional skater who closes his gaps really well, is sound technically with his footwork and has an easy burst that he generates from each stride. He hits with the impact of a much bigger player. He's a tenacious defenseman who embraces the physical part of the game. With the puck, Hicketts has put up a lot of points in his limited playing time. He's an aware puck distributor who can jump into the play and is creative in how he tries to generate offense.</p>
<p><b>41. Lucas Wallmark | C | Lulea (SHL)<br>
DOB: 9/5/95 | 2013-14 stats: 41 GP, 3 G, 7 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>It was a mild surprise when Wallmark went undrafted in 2013, despite being one of the top forwards for the Swedish under-18 team. Health and skating scared teams away then, but with a healthy season in the books he will likely be selected in 2014. Wallmark can QB a power play with the best of them, and his patience and vision are distinguishable traits to go along with above-average hands. His soft touch allows him to elevate the puck well as a passer, on top of being able to maneuver well in tight spaces. He's lacking as a defensive presence and skater, but he finds ways to generate scoring chances, and has top-six potential at the NHL level.</p>
<p><b>42. John Quenneville | C | Brandon (WHL)<br>
DOB: 4/16/96 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 25 G, 33 A, 71 PIM</b></p>
<p>John is a second cousin to <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> head coach Joel Quenneville, and the nephew of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/bos/boston-bruins">Boston Bruins</a> defenseman <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2072/johnny-boychuk">Johnny Boychuk</a> by marriage. He is strong in puck possession, can make quick decisions with the puck, and works hard to get to the net and win battles. Scouts describe him as a very dangerous player from the hashmarks in. John's skating needs some work, as his first few steps aren't the best. He's improved a fair amount defensively and has become a fine penalty killer.</p>
<p><b>43. Oskar Lindblom | LW | Brynas (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 8/15/96 | 2013-14 stats: 43 GP, 13 G, 20 A, 28 PIM</b></p>
<p>Lindblom turned a lot of heads as an under-age player at the 2013 under-17 world championships, when he led the tournament in scoring; bear in mind that this was an event that featured many of this draft class' top prospects. He hasn't lived up to that performance this season, but he remains very intriguing. Lindblom is a strong power winger who gets praise for the tough brand of hockey he brings out of his 6-2, 187-pound frame. He's a solid skater with a fine top gear and he can be a handful for defenders. He's not the most gifted skill guy, with one NHL exec saying, "He's always going to have to find tough ways to score, because he won't beat guys with the puck."</p>
<p><b>44. Emil Johansson | D | HV71 (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 5/6/96 | 2013-14 stats: 42 GP, 2 G, 7 A, 28 PIM</b></p>
<p>Johansson will never stand out in a dynamic way, but he's a "bring your lunchpail" type of player who gets the job done every game. He skates well in terms of both speed and agility, and is a capable defender, despite average size (6-0, 194 pounds). Johansson reads the play at a high level in terms of body and stick positioning, and makes the right decisions off the puck. He's not a great puck handler, but he sees the ice fine and is able to make decent plays offensively due to his hockey IQ.</p>
<p><b>45. Jayce Hawryluk | C | Brandon (WHL)<br>
DOB: 1/1/96 | 2013-14 stats: 59 GP, 24 G, 40 A, 44 PIM</b></p>
<p>Hawryluk has put up a good chunk of points between his 16- and 17-year-old seasons, and was a top scorer for the Wheat Kings this season. He can make plays in open ice, but is more impressive as a passer. Hawryluk's intangibles are more of a standout quality than his skills: He has a great work ethic, and is a strong, physical player. "He protects the puck well, pressures defensemen well, and comes back hard on the back check," said one scout. Hawryluk plays the tough defensive minutes, and projects to be an all-situations player in the NHL. It's unclear whether he has enough offensive skill to be a pro scorer, although he's intriguing in that aspect of the game.</p>
<p><b>46. Ondrej Kase | RW | Chomutov (Czech Extraliga)<br>
DOB: 11/8/95 | 2013-14 stats: 37 GP, 4 G, 3 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>The first time I saw Kase play was at last year's world under-18 championships, and there were at least 10 instances when he made you think, "Hey, who is that guy?" Kase is a skilled player who has the ability to dazzle with his puck skills. On top of his puck creativity, he has good overall offensive instincts and above-average speed, acceleration and edge control. He has a long way to go physically, as he's 6-0, 165 pounds and loses a lot of battles as a result. Kase won't be a team's best all-around player, and won't be killing penalties, but he's certainly adept as a scorer.</p>
<p><b>47. Ben Thomas | D | Calgary (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/28/96 | 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 7 G, 24 A, 39 PIM</b></p>
<p>Thomas isn't great at any one thing, but does a lot at a good level. He's an above-average skater with a nice quick burst that allows him to be active from the blue line. He doesn't have great puck skills, but he has good vision and instincts. Thomas outlets the puck well, has anticipation of when to join the rush and make quick decisions with the puck. He's a pretty hard-working player on defense who will battle and get in front of pucks, but he doesn't land high-impact hits. He's a fine defensive player overall, but can clean up some of his positioning. He doesn't have a high ceiling, but could be a useful pro.</p>
<p><b>48. Ryan Donato | C | Dexter School (U.S. high school)<br>
DOB: 4/9/96 | 2013-14 stats: 30 GP, 37 G, 41 A</b></p>
<p>Donato's offensive instincts are tremendous in terms of his creativity, vision, and positional play, although there is some element of uncertainty given the level of competition against which he played. Donato's an average-sized player (6-0, 176 pounds), who needs to add bulk, but he has two-way value. He's not a slow skater per se, but he's not the quickest guy when you adjust for his size. He has enough talent to potentially be a pro scorer, but he could also be effective playing in a bottom-six role as well. He is committed to playing for his father, former NHLer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/223/ted-donato">Ted Donato</a>, at Harvard University for the 2015-16 season.</p>
<p><b>49. Jack Glover | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/17/96 | 2013-14 stats: 59 GP, 2 G, 26 A, 30 PIM </b></p>
<p>At his best, Glover has the tools to excel at both ends of the rink. He's a good to very good skater, with solid puck skills. At 6-3, 192 pounds, he makes distinct plays for a man his size, and is a player whose ceiling is still being defined. The downside is his decision-making. "He can get caught running around," said one scout. Another scout said, "He's inconsistent; the hockey IQ worries me sometimes." To be fair, Glover has improved immensely on defense; during the latter part of the season, he was one of the best players defensively for the NTDP, logging the tough assignments effectively. But again, he's hard to get a read on, and has some risk-reward elements to his game. He is committed to the University of Minnesota for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>50. Vaclav Karabacek | RW | Gatineau (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 5/2/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 21 G, 26 A, 40 PIM</b></p>
<p>Karabacek has played ahead of his age group for the Czechs in international play, and was in Austria during 2012-13 ahead of his encouraging North American debut in 2013-14. He controls the puck with some flashy skills, and good overall instincts and decision making. His shot has developed well, as he gets the puck off his stick quickly and with accuracy. His size (5-11, 185 pounds) is a limitation, but not to the same degree as some of the other skilled forwards on this list.</p><p></p>
