<p>Compared to the much-anticipated 2013 NHL draft class -- a group that featured projected elite talents such as <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041969/nathan-mackinnon">Nathan MacKinnon</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041992/seth-jones">Seth Jones</a> -- this year's prospect pool has been flying a little under the radar. But when you start to put the 2014 crop under the microscope, it's clear that there is still plenty of talent to be harvested.</p>

<div class="mod-content">
<h4>Prospect ranking methodology</h4>
<p>Rankings are based on discussions with scouts on top of video and live viewings, and place a slight emphasis on puck possession, based on studies that show it is the <a href="http://vhockey.blogspot.com/2009/05/possession-is-everything.html" target="new">best predictive measure</a> of team-level success. Performance is a secondary factor, adjusted for age, team strength, league quality and other contextual elements.</p> 
<p>Defensemen are given slightly less value than forwards of equal skill level because of higher projection uncertainty inherent in the position. </p> 
</div>
</div>
<!-- END INLINE MODULE --><!-- end inline 1 --></p>
<p>To put it in perspective, compared to last year's draft class (without our current hindsight), I'd have ranked <strong>Aaron Ekblad</strong> behind MacKinnon and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041971/jonathan-drouin">Jonathan Drouin</a>, with a tough debate about how close he was to Jones and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3042003/valeri-nichushkin">Valeri Nichushkin</a>. He'd have ranked ahead of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041970/aleksander-barkov">Aleksander Barkov</a>, however. I'd then have <strong>Sam Bennett</strong> and the rest of the top tier after Barkov.</p>
<p>Although the No. 1 and 2 prospects are below-average compared to the players who have fallen in that range historically, the middle of the top end -- the No. 5 to 10 range -- is somewhat <em>above-</em>average. This draft may not be one that produces superstars, but there are some very useful players here.</p>
<p>There is a slight drop-off after Ekblad, and the next tier runs three prospects deep, with another tier from No. 5 to 9. There's a good argument to fit any of the next seven prospects after the No. 9 slot into that group, but the rest of the draft is a gradual decline from there.</p>
<p>The OHL is represented well, with 10 players in the top 30. This is also a strong year for European leagues, particularly the Swedish ones, as for the first time those leagues emerged as the preferred alternative for top non-Swedish prospects overseas. <strong>Kevin Fiala</strong> (Switzerland) as well as <strong>David Pastrnak</strong> and <strong>Jakub Vrana</strong> (Czech Republic) played in Sweden's top leagues and developed well.</p>
<p>It's also a comparatively strong class in terms of netminders, led by <strong>Thatcher Demko</strong>. However, this is a poor year for defensemen. After my No. 1 overall prospect, Ekblad, it's a big drop to <strong>Haydn Fleury</strong> (No. 10), and on the whole, there are only four defensemen in my top 30 skaters.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this is a personal ranking, and I am aware it does not necessarily reflect an industry consensus. For example, it is likely that both <strong>Leon Draisaitl</strong> (No. 7) and <strong>Michael Dal Colle</strong> (No. 8) go in the top five on June 27.</p>
<p>The following players make up numbers 51 through 100 on my list, and I've also included a handful that just missed:</p><p></p>

<p><b>51. Marcus Pettersson | D | Skelleftea (SHL)<br>
DOB: 5/8/96 | 2013-14 stats: 10 GP, 0 G, 0 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>Pettersson recently converted to defense from forward, and there are understandably raw elements in his game due to his transition, but he's also an intriguing player due to his upside and how he's tracking. Pettersson has quick feet, overall good range for a defender and skates very well for a big man (6-foot-3, 161 pounds). His skill and offensive instincts are still evident from his forward days, as he moves the puck well and can join the attack. His defensive sense and reads are a significant work in progress. Pettersson can struggle with gap control and containing the better forwards. Despite being a big guy, he's not the toughest on his checks and needs to work on his strength.</p>
<p><b>52. Alex Peters | D | Plymouth (OHL)<br>
DOB: 7/2/96 | 2013-14 stats: 50 GP, 3 G, 6 A, 44 PIM</b></p>
<p>Alex is the younger brother of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/car/carolina-hurricanes">Carolina Hurricanes</a> goaltender <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3229/justin-peters">Justin Peters</a>, and has really grown into his role as a quality shutdown defenseman. Peters is a big defender, standing 6-4 and weighing 205 pounds. He uses his frame well, competing hard in battles and boxing forwards away from the high-percentage areas. Peters is an average skater but fine for his size. He's a pretty aware defensive player, who understands all the things he needs to do to get possession of the puck back. Peters positions himself well in the defensive zone, and doesn't get caught running around. His puck skills are poor, as he can struggle at times handling the puck or moving it up the ice. He shows some competence in that area at the Junior stage, but likely is a replacement-level offensive player as a pro.</p>

<p><b>53. Brendan Lemieux | LW | Barrie-OHL<br>
DOB: 3/15/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 27 G, 26 A, 145 PIM</b></p>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/534/claude-lemieux">Claude Lemieux</a>'s son brings some of the same intangibles and pestering qualities as his father. He's a very strong winger who is physical and intense every shift. Lemieux is an above-average skater, although I've gotten mixed reviews from scouts on that area of his game. Some scouts I've talked to note they aren't crazy about his skating, but every time I've seen him he's looked impressive in that area. Lemieux has good balance and is effective protecting the puck. He isn't an overly skilled player, but he's decent offensively with good instincts. On his best shifts, his hockey IQ shines through, but Lemieux needs to work on reigning in his emotions and not taking bad penalties, which he does often. The apple didn't fall far from the tree on that front. He has the ability to be a scoring, physical winger if he pans out.</p>
<p><b>54. Brycen Martin | D | Swift Current (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/9/96| 2013-14: 72 GP, 6 G, 31 A, 42 PIM</b></p>
<p>Martin is a pretty effective two-way defenseman who isn't the kind of player that stands out in a highlight reel type of way. However, he does a lot of things well. He's a really smart puck mover who plays well under pressure. His first pass and transition game get high praise from NHL sources. Martin is a clear above-average skater with active feet, good four-way movements and nice power in his steps, with solid to above-average puck skills. He's a physical player who leans on his checks and battles well. Martin can be fine in his own end, and while he'll still make the odd mistake typical of players his age, he understands the game defensively.</p>
<p><b>55. Aaron Haydon | D | Niagara (OHL)<br>
DOB: 2/2/96 | 2013-14: 61 GP, 5 G, 11 A, 112 PIM</b></p>
<p>The Plymouth, Michigan native had a fine second OHL season, excelling defensively and getting more offensive responsibility as the season went on. His physical tools are very good and drive his value. Haydon is a 6-3, 200-pound defender who is physical and wins a ton of battles. Haydon regularly landed pretty quality hits. He closes gaps well due to his quality mobility with enough speed to be an asset on the rush. Haydon's decisions in his 16-year-old season were a significant concern, but he's played a style this season that incorporates much less risk and the results have been positive. Haydon handles the puck fine and can deliver an accurate, crisp outlet. His defensive reads are decent, but he can still be turned to the outside or miss his man a little too much. He'll need time, but has upside to be worth waiting on.</p>
<p><b>56. Jack Dougherty, D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/25/96| 2013-14 stats: 55 GP, 6 G, 16 A, 65 PIM</b></p>
<p>Dougherty had a pretty solid first season with the NTDP, entering the program after playing high school hockey. He is a pretty toolsy defender, who stands out offensively. His skating ranges from good to excellent. He moves well in all directions, with nice explosiveness in his first step and overall refined footwork and skating technique. Dougherty is dangerous with the puck as a rusher and distributor. He's got some creativity with the puck in his game and can beat checkers one-on-one. Dougherty is an average-sized player (6-2, 185 pounds), but has some bite to his game. Where he struggles is with his decisions and reads. Dougherty will get beat a little too often, and also give the puck away more than he should. He needs to manage his risk better and pick his spots on when to attack. He is committed to the University of Wisconsin for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>57. Rourke Chartier | C | Kelowna (WHL)<br>
DOB: 4/2/96| 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 24 G, 34 A, 8 PIM</b></p>
<p>Chartier had a very slow start to the season, with just nine points through the first 25 games, but had an outstanding second half. He's been an all-situations player for Kelowna but really impresses in the defensive parts of the game. Chartier is a pretty good skater and can be a nuisance on the forecheck or getting in lanes on the penalty kill. He understands the defensive game very well and with his good faceoff skills, projects as a potential tough minutes player at the NHL level. Chartier's notable weakness is his height, as he stands 5-11.</p>
<p><b>58. Louis Belpedio | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/14/96| 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 7 G, 16 A, 46 PIM</b></p>
<p>Belpedio was a solid two-way defenseman for the NTDP this season and is part of the rare breed of right-handed defenders who play the left side well. Belpedio has pretty quick feet and skates well for a defender, meaning he's mobile going in all directions, has good footwork and can also join the attack. Belpedio may be a bit small (5-11), but he's strong and works hard to win battles. This combined with his very high hockey IQ makes him a good penalty killer, and he logged some tough minutes for the NTDP. He is committed to the University of Miami (Ohio) for the 2015-16 season.</p>
<p><b>59. Clark Bishop | C | Cape Breton (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 3/29/96| 2013-14 stats: 56 GP, 14 G, 19 A, 54 PIM</b></p>
<p>Bishop was the No. 3 overall pick in the 2012 QMJHL draft, and while he hasn't put up great stats, there are a lot of appealing attributes to his game. He's an above-average to plus skater who gets up and down the ice well due to a great natural stride on top of an elite work ethic. The "Go" switch is always turned on with Bishop. The issue with Bishop is how much offense he ultimately will produce. A minority of scouts feel he will score in the NHL, but most see him as a third-line player, due to average puck skills and below-average finishing ability.</p>
<p><b>60. William Lagesson | D | Frolunda (J20SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 2/22/96 | 2013-14 stats: 44 GP, 8 G, 12 A, 30 PIM</b></p>
<p>If you quickly look up Lagesson's numbers, they aren't all that impressive. Despite his low point totals, he's an impressive overall player who was very solid representing Sweden at the international level. Lagesson stands in at 6-2, 196 pounds, and thinks the game very well in his own end. He's always getting his stick on pucks, is in the right position to angle his man off and anticipates offensive pressure well. Lagesson also excels on the penalty kill due to these attributes. His passing is solid, and while Lagesson doesn't look like a player who will get much power play time at the pro level, he's a calm, smooth puck mover who can aid in the transition game.</p>
<p><b>61. Joshua Jacobs | D | Indiana (USHL)<br>
DOB: 2/15/96 | 2013-14 stats: 56 GP, 5 G, 18 A, 46 PIM</b></p>
<p>Jacobs is a player about whom I get mixed feelings when I talk to USHL scouts. He was a USHL All-Star this season, and one of the few under-18s for USA at the World Jr. A Challenge. "He's a tremendous athlete," said one scout. Jacobs is an above-average if not a high-end skater who can lead rushes and is mobile in all directions, and also has a good frame and doesn't shy away from the physical parts of the game. While Jacobs has good flashes of defensive value in the USHL, there are concerns about his defense going forward. His hockey sense is below-average, regularly making bad decisions with the puck or missing assignments. He is committed to Michigan State for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>62. Alexis Vanier | D | Baie-Comeau (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 12/21/95 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 15 G, 21 A, 52 PIM</b></p>
<p>Vanier was fine as a 17-year-old, but he showed significant growth in his second QMJHL season. He's a giant on the ice at 6-5, 225 pounds, and on top of that he throws the body around regularly. Vanier is obviously an elite physical player at the junior level, and projects to be the same as a pro. He also has the capability to get his entire frame into a bomb of a shot, which makes him quite dangerous on the power play. His skating is a weakness, as his turns are a little awkward, and while he has a great wingspan, he can still be beat wide.</p>
<p><b>63. Ryan MacInnis | C | Kitchener (OHL)<br>
DOB: 2/14/96 | 2013-14 stats: 66 GP, 16 G, 21 A, 18 PIM</b></p>
<p>The son of Hall of Famer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/554/al-macinnis">Al MacInnis</a> is a big, skilled center who will need several years to develop. However, he has significant potential. MacInnis is a 6-4 playmaker who, at the junior level, is tough to get off of the puck. He's a really smart player who makes plays under pressure, can see the ice even when he's not looking down his options, and understands positional hockey at an advanced level in every zone. MacInnis needs to work on his skating, as he's got a bit of an awkward stride and is not the best in the speed department. His shot also has some room for improvement, which may surprise some, considering his father's legendary work in that department.</p>

<p><b>64. Chase De Leo | C | Portland (WHL)<br>
DOB: 10/25/95 | 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 39 G, 42 A, 36 PIM</b></p>
<p>De Leo has been a tough guy to evaluate the past two seasons, due to being low on the depth chart on stacked offensive teams. He's a pretty talented player in his own right, but not along the lines of players who have been drafted high out of Portland recently (<a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5434/ryan-johansen">Ryan Johansen</a>, Seth Jones and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5511/nino-niederreiter">Nino Niederreiter</a> among them). He's certainly an above-average skater and flashes beyond that. When you combine his shifty skating with his good puck skills, it makes him a pretty tough player to check. De Leo's size isn't ideal at around 5-9, but he works hard on both ends. He won't be an overly physical forward or great defensively, but he shows effort in those areas and can be moderately effective.</p>
<p><b>65. Aaron Irving | D | Edmonton (WHL)<br>
DOB: 3/13/96 | 2013-14 stats: 63 GP, 9 G, 21 A, 88 PIM</b></p>
<p>In his first full WHL season, Irving took substantial steps forward after coming in as a possible late-round pick. He has average size (6-1, 190 pounds), but he is really tough to play against. He's strong in one-on-one battles, often coming out with the puck. Irving gets in lanes, gets his stick in the right spot, plays simple positional hockey and makes good outlets. He's not an overwhelming offensive talent, but has some ability with the puck and a big shot from the point. Irving's skating can stand to improve as he can be beat wide.</p>
<p><b>66. Maxim Letunov | C | Youngstown (USHL)<br>
DOB: 2/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 60 GP, 19 G, 24 A, 42 PIM</b></p>
<p>Letunov has one of the more fascinating development paths you'll see. Born in Moscow, he came to the United States and played his midget-level hockey in Dallas before heading to Ohio to play junior, and is committed to Boston University for the 2014-15 season. Scouts commonly describe Letunov as a dynamic forward whose puck skills and offensive creativity are high-end. He has the ability to make unique plays with the puck and creates a large amount of chances. His skating is subpar, however, with several NHL scouts pointing to a severe lack of lower-body strength and a wonky stride. His overall physical game is also poor despite a good work ethic, and at 6-2, 155 pounds, he's a bit of a string bean.</p>
<p><b>67. Brandon Fortunato | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 6/7/96 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 3 G, 34 A, 14 PIM</b></p>
<p>Fortunato was the top scoring defenseman on the NTDP this season, and his production is a reflection of his offensive talent. Fortunato is an excellent skater who accelerates at a high-end level, is quick in every direction and very tough to check or pressure on the forecheck due to skating ability. Fortunato is also a skilled puck handler and puck mover, who leads a power play very well. His size is his biggest issue, as he's a pretty small defenseman (5-10, 148 pounds) who isn't the best in one-on-one battles. Fortunato is solid in terms of defensive reads, but as of now his defensive value is a significant question mark due to his size and lack of standout defensive sense. He is committed to Boston University for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>68. Miles Gendron | D | The Rivers School (US high school)<br>
DOB: 6/28/96 | 2013-14 stats: 22 GP, 6 G, 13 A</b></p>
<p>Gendron is described by scouts as a high-tools type of prospect who is raw. The latter part stems from the recent change from forward to defense on top of lack of playing time versus quality opponents. "He's an elite skater" said one NHL scout, as Gendron has the first few step bursts and overall top gear to be a dangerous puck rusher. He has good upside, but a team drafting Gendron has to understand the risks. He still has a ways to go in learning the position, in terms of reads and improving his physical play. Gendron has decent size (6-2, 172 pounds), but could stand to bulk up more.</p>
<p><b>69. Brett Pollock | C | Edmonton (WHL)<br>
DOB: 3/16/96 | 2013-14 stats: 71 GP, 25 G, 30 A, 36 PIM</b></p>
<p>After notching just 15 points in his first 55 WHL games (40 in 2012-13, 15 in 2013-14), a switch flipped midseason, and he had 45 points in 40 games from November to the end of the season. Pollock has above-average puck skills with impressive coordination and ability to maintain possession. He's not a blazing skater, but he has a good top gear with decent first steps. Pollock can really lean into his shots as well. Despite his size (6-2, 183 pounds), Pollock is a bit of a gentle player when it comes to physical play. Pollock's overall defensive work needs to pick up as well.</p>
<p><b>70. Andreas Englund | D | Djurgarden (Allsvenskan)<br>
DOB: 1/21/96 | 2013-14 stats: 19 GP, 1 G, 1 A, 14 PIM</b></p>
<p>Englund spent some time in both the junior and professional ranks this season, playing very well in the second half and was good for Sweden at the international under-18 level as well. He's physically intriguing at 6-3, 190 pounds, especially when considering he uses his body well to win puck battles, and at times land some crushing physical blows. He's certainly a quality penalty killer who can make stops, and at even strength his sense allows him to check tougher players. Englund's puck moving is decent, but he'll never be confused for a puck wizard.</p>
<p><b>71. Nick Magyar | RW | Kitchener (OHL)<br>
DOB: 5/29/96 | 2013-14 stats: 66 GP, 20 G, 26 A, 20 PIM</b></p>
<p>Magyar was one of the top rookies in the OHL this season, leading the Kitchener Rangers in scoring. He's an average-sized forward who is strong on the puck, with a good work ethic. He shows flashes of being a creative player with the puck, although that part of his game isn't too consistent. Magyar skates well and is dangerous in transition on top of having an impressive shot. His work ethic makes him a decent penalty killer, although he'll still need to work on his positioning off the puck.</p>
<p><b>72. Ryan Hitchcock | LW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 3/30/96 | 2013-14 stats: 53 GP, 12 G, 37 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>Hitchcock is a pretty good all-around forward, who was up around a point per game for the NTDP this season. Hitchcock plays the game with speed and energy and is very dangerous taking the puck through the neutral zone due to his skating ability. He can kill penalties effectively, and is good at pressuring opposing players. Hitchcock is a smaller player at 5-10, and the biggest question is what role he'll play as a pro. Is he skilled enough to score, and if not, is he big enough to check? There's enough talent with Ryan in all areas of the game that it's worth gambling on him should he improve in any one area. He's committed to Yale University for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>73. Ryan Collins | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/6/96 | 2013-14 stats: 59 GP, 1 G, 6 A, 26 PIM</b></p>
<p>Collins is a monster of a man at 6-5, 200 pounds, who has some intriguing tools for a big man. He's an above-average skater for a player his size, and can evade pressure fine. He's a very heady defenseman who scouts praise for his cool demeanor and overall reads defensively. He has certain smoothness about the simple, effective way he plays. He also uses his big frame well to win battles and knock players off pucks. His obvious flaw is offensive skill; while he has decent poise with the puck, he can look a little clumsy and doesn't generate a ton of offensive creativity. He's committed to the University of Minnesota for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>74. Jake Walman | D | Toronto Jr. Canadiens (OJHL)<br>
DOB: 2/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 43 GP, 7 G, 26 A, 97 PIM</b></p>
<p>Walman is the top prospect in Canada's junior-A tier. He recently changed positions from forward to defense, and that position change has done a lot for him as a prospect. "He's a pure athlete," said one scout of Walman. He's an explosive skater who gets out of the gates really well, and for a recent convert to defense, his backward skating and pivots are exceptional. Walman is slightly below-average size-wise and needs bulk, but when I've watched him in small samples I've liked what I've seen from him physically in terms of hits and battles. However, scouts who have seen him more extensively have criticized that area of his game. Walman is a pretty skilled puck mover with a big shot who has all the tools to be a big-time offensive player. His defense needs a lot of work though, understandably, and his decisions aren't always the best. He is committed to Providence College for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>75. Dysin Mayo | D | Edmonton (WHL)<br>
DOB: 8/17/96 | 2013-14 stats: 63 GP, 7 G, 28 A, 50 PIM</b></p>
<p>Mayo saw a big spike in scoring this season as he was part of a strong Oil Kings defensive group. Mayo is a strong skater with the speed and bursts to lead the attack effectively. His skill set doesn't really stand out in a major way, though, and I'm unsure exactly what type of role he would have as a pro. But there's enough to his game in many areas to make him worth a mid-round selection.</p>
<p><b>76. Matthew Berkovitz | D | Ashwaubenon (US high school)<br>
DOB: 2/16/96 | 2013-14 stats: 24 GP, 11 G, 26 A, 12 PIM</b></p>
<p>Berkovitz is the rare top prospect to come out of the Wisconsin high school ranks. He's a pretty gifted player on a tools level. He's a good puck mover from the back end, who displays the vision and overall instincts to be an effective player with his outlets, rushes and when he gets his power-play time. Scouts note that his hockey sense does stand out, but the main issue with Berkovitz is the level of competition he's faced and trying to evaluate him there. He's committed to the University of Wisconsin for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>77. Blake Siebenaler | D | Niagara (OHL)<br>
DOB: 2/27/96 | 2013-14 stats: 68 GP, 6 G, 24 A, 24 PIM</b></p>
<p>Siebenaler had a good first season in the OHL, and is one of the better pure skaters in his draft class. His ability to escape pressure, rush through the zone and burst well in all directions makes him an appealing prospect. Siebenaler's upside is what you dream on, because for now he's a bit of a work in progress defensively. He's raw for the OHL level in his own end in terms of the physicality required and his overall defensive reads, although his strength level is decent.</p>
<p><b>78. Gustav Forsling | D | Linkoping (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 6/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 44 GP, 6 G, 12 A, 36 PIM</b></p>
<p>Forsling is a toolsy offensive defenseman who impressed in league play during the second half of the season. He excels controlling the flow on the power play. He's a smart and creative player, but also knows how to make the safe plays. His defense has improved notably, however he can still be turned or beaten by better forwards.</p>
<p><b>79. Nicolas Aube-Kubel | RW | Val-d'Or (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 5/10/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 22 G, 31 A, 61 PIM</b></p>
<p>Aube-Kubel was a top pick in the 2012 QMJHL draft that has played well, but still has more potential than what he's shown so far. He's a really gifted puck handler who on his best game creates chances out of nothing and can be dangerous in open ice. He's not a fantastic skater, but he has a fine top gear and good agility. He also has an impressive shot. Aube-Kubel isn't the best off the puck though, as he can struggle a bit with his reads on both ends. The majority view is that his defensive play and consistency are both knocks on his game, although one scout I talked to did praise his defense.</p>
<p><b>80. Jonathan MacLeod | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 6/2/96 | 2013-14 stats: 51 GP, 5 G, 6 A, 70 PIM</b></p>
<p>MacLeod is not a really flashy defenseman but he provided a steady, consistent shift in the NTDP lineup this season. He can land quality hits, and is effective battling for pucks. His hockey IQ is exceptional, as he possesses a calm demeanor in regards to how he goes about the game. While MacLeod probably won't be an NHL power-play guy, he demonstrates great puck-moving ability, flashes of good offensive IQ and an accurate shot through traffic. He is committed to Boston University for the 2015-16 season.</p>
<p><b>81. Warren Foegele | LW | St. Andrews (CAN high school)<br>
DOB: 4/1/96 | 2013-14 stats: 52 GP, 58 G, 49 A, 67 PIM</b></p>
<p>Foegele was around a two points-per-game player (in a weak league, mind you) this season, but despite those numbers he doesn't really project as an offensive scorer in the big leagues. "He's not really creative and lacks touch," said one scout. Rather, Foegele is more of your standard heart-and-soul type of forward, with some puck ability. Foegele is a nonstop engine during every shift, who battles hard at all ends of the ice. He attacks the high percentage areas and has an attitude that can make him a fan favorite. He's committed to the University of New Hampshire for the 2014-15 season.</p>

<p><b>82. Jacob Middleton | D | Ottawa (OHL)<br>
DOB: 1/2/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 2 G, 21 A, 64 PIM</b></p>
<p>Middleton has been a top prospect for a few seasons. He was drafted eighth overall in the 2012 OHL draft, and was very impressive as a 16-year-old in the OHL and at the under-17 world challenge competition. He didn't have a great 17-year-old season, but there's still a lot of reason for optimism with Middleton. He's big, developed physically for his size (6-2, 207 pounds), and does a lot physically in terms of winning battles and boxing out forwards. Middleton is not just a bruiser though, as he's an aware positional defender who makes a lot of stops. His puck skills aren't the best, and Middleton hasn't been the most consistent player, although being on a bad team may have made him seem worse than he is.</p>
<p><b>83. Andrei Mironov | D | Dynamo Moscow (KHL)<br>
DOB: 7/29/94 | 2013-14 stats: 46 GP, 3 G, 7 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>After going undrafted twice, I'm skeptical that the third time will be a charm for Mironov, but he's a player who has grown on me from his time internationally and in the KHL. Mironov is a fine two-way defender, whose value is likely tilted toward the defensive end. His off-puck positioning is solid, and overall he displays above-average defensive reads in terms of anticipating the flow, getting in lanes and stopping rushes. Mironov won't be a team's best offensive player, but he's a good enough skater to join the rush and offensively.</p>
<p><b>84. Michael Bunting | LW | Sault Ste. Marie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 9/17/95 | 2013-14 stats: 48 GP, 15 G, 27 A, 34 PIM</b></p>
<p>Bunting is one of the more interesting stories among the prospects in my top three rounds. At 17 years old this past season, Bunting was playing at the midget AAA level, and nowhere near the NHL radar. The progress he has made in such a short amount of time is telling to why many rave about his character. He possesses a high level of skill, and has the coordination to make tough plays with the puck. At his best, he can be an offensive force, but he's a pretty raw player due to the lack of high-level play. Bunting is a high-risk, high-reward pick in the middle rounds.</p>
<p><b>85. Reid Gardiner | C | Prince Albert (WHL)<br>
DOB: 1/19/96 | 2013-14 stats: 70 GP, 22 G, 22 A, 39 PIM</b></p>
<p>Gardiner was a top prospect coming up through the bantam-level ranks, and while he hasn't flourished as a top-end WHL player, he's pretty gifted. "He thinks the game well offensively and makes quick decisions," said one scout. Gardiner is below-average in size (5-11, 185 pounds), but he's got a fine strength level already, and wins a good chunk of battles. He also is able to score from mid distance due to a nice wrist shot. Scouts I've talked to like his defensive play and his work off the puck, but from what I've seen I believe those areas could use work.</p>
<p><b>86. Anders Bjork | RW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 8/5/96 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 21 G, 21 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>The Wisconsin native is a versatile forward who had a quality season with the NTDP. He's a quick, agile skater and when combined with his puck skills, Bjork can be tough to check. Bjork is a hard-working forward who can kill penalties at an OK level, and understands how to position himself off the puck. He's committed to Notre Dame for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>87. Brandon Hickey | D | Spruce Grove (AJHL)<br>
DOB: 4/13/96 | 2013-14 stats: 37 GP, 4 G, 12, 22 PIM</b></p>
<p>Hickey hasn't put up great numbers this season, but scouts I've talked to have consistently raved about him on a tools level. He's a plus skater with explosive movements in all four directions. He's a smart two-way player who can outlet the puck at a high level. Hickey has some creativity to his game, though scouts think he has more to show in that area. One scout said, "He has the offensive tools, but he can be too conservative at times. He needs to be more offensive oriented, take more chances." Scouts are also divided on his physicality. He's committed to Boston University for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>88. Luc Snuggerud | D | Eden Prairie (U.S. high school)<br>
DOB: 9/18/95 | 2013-14 stats: 25 GP, 8 G, 30 A, 19 PIM</b></p>
<p>Snuggerud is the top high school prospect to come out of the Minnesota ranks this season. He's a high-end skater who is described as "explosive" by scouts, due to how well he rushes up the ice and can lead the offensive charge. He's also a very mobile all-directions player who stays with the fastest forwards effectively. He has a fine shot, and gets the puck through lanes well. He has a few flaws, though. Luc is a tad small (5-11, 165 pounds), and doesn't project as a great physical player. His reads can be off a little too often in terms of risk-taking and not playing at the ideal pace. He is committed to the University of Nebraska-Omaha for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>89. Juho Lammikko | RW | Assat (Liiga)<br>
DOB: 1/29/96 | 2013-14 stats: 20 GP, 0 G, 1 A, 0 PIM</b></p>
<p>Lammikko had a decent season, where he impressed in International competition, and while he got 20 games in Finland's top pro league, he notched only one point. Juho has an intriguing tool kit as he's a big forward (6-3, 189 pounds) who is strong on the puck. He also has good offensive tools as an above-average puck handler with offensive creativity. He plays strategically at both ends, although as always with young players, a little tweaking in his D positioning could help. Skating is the most notable area of weakness for Lammikko, as he's not the quickest out of the gates.</p>
<p><b>90. Nelson Nogier | D | Saskatoon (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/27/96 | 2013-14 stats: 37 GP, 1 G, 5 A, 25 PIM</b></p>
<p>Nogier's stats aren't the prettiest, as he's not a points producer and he missed a good chunk of this season due to a shoulder injury. However, it's his the combination of skating and size (6-2, 192 pounds) that makes him an appealing prospect. He makes stops by getting in shot and passing lanes, but also stays with his checks well and has fine overall positioning. He isn't an overly physical player, but he will use his body when needed and battles fine. His main weakness is evident; his offensive capabilities are next to nothing. Nogier will provide a decent outlet pass, but that's the extent of his puck skills.</p>
<p><b>91. Julius Bergman | D | Frolunda (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 11/2/95 | 2013-14 stats: 45 GP, 13 G, 21 A, 54 PIM</b></p>
<p>Bergman is average in size (6-1, 196 pounds), but has fine physical value because he plays hard and wins battles. Bergman plays a smart, steady defensive game with his positioning and overall reads, and his potential value will be as a penalty-killing defenseman who plays against talented players. He's not the most skilled puck handler in the world, and won't project onto an NHL power play, but has enough vision and offensive IQ to outlet and escape pressure.</p>
<p><b>92. Nikita Tryamkin | D | Yekaterinburg (KHL)<br>
DOB: 8/30/94 | 2013-14 stats: 45 GP, 1 G, 6 A, 38 PIM</b></p>
<p>Tryamkin had a breakout season as a 19-year-old, following a somewhat typical delayed development path. Tryamkin's size is his clear best asset -- he's 6-7, 228 pounds, and skates and handles the puck well for a big man. Tryamkin doesn't have fantastic puck skills, but he did fine on Russia's second PP unit at the World Junior Championship, and has solid projection offensively.</p>
<p><b>93. Reid Duke | C | Lethbridge (WHL)<br>
DOB: 1/28/96 | 2013-14 stats: 62 GP, 15 G, 25 A, 91 PIM</b></p>
<p>Duke was among Lethbridge's top scorers on what's been a poor team of late. He's a former top-five WHL draft pick with a lot of promise if he puts it all together; a highly talented forward with the offensive IQ, hand-eye ability and creativity to make distinct plays with the puck. Duke has to round out his game, though. In addition to overcoming less than ideal size (6-0, 187 pounds), scouts also note that he needs to work on his consistency. He could be a decent mid-to-late round pick.</p>
<p><b>94. Adam Olas Mattson | D | Djurgarden (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 7/30/96| 2013-14 stats: 33 GP, 1 G, 8 A, 42 PIM</b></p>
<p>I heard mixed reports about Olas Mattson's play this season, as can be expected of a pretty gifted athlete who still has some things to improve. Olas Mattson is huge -- 6-4, 209 pounds -- and has fine mobility for a player his size. He's a solid defender who uses his body very well to separate players off pucks and win battles. His positioning is mostly fine, but he can suffer from the odd brain cramp in the defensive zone. His main weakness is with the puck, as he's pretty limited from puck skills standpoint.</p>
<p><b>95. Jaedon Descheneau | RW | Kootenay (WHL)<br>
DOB: 2/22/95 | 2013-14 stats: 70 GP, 44 G, 54 A, 54 PIM</b></p>
<p>Deschenau was passed over in last year's draft, but with more eyes on him due to Sam Reinhart attracting scouts to Kootenay's games -- and continued high-level performance -- he may be selected this time around. Descheneau is a highly talented little guy (5-9, 185 pounds) who has put up big numbers in the WHL, although given his age it's slightly less impressive. His hockey sense is exceptional. He really understands how to make plays to avoid defenders and create chances through his vision and plus puck skills. His speed isn't fantastic, which isn't ideal for a small player. The main issue with Descheneau is clearly his frame. When you're under 5-10, you need to blow people away offensively, and currently, Descheneau is on the fringe.</p>
<p><b>96. Alex Lintuniemi | D | Ottawa (OHL)<br>
DOB: 9/23/95 | 2013-14 stats: 68 GP, 4 G, 17 A, 26 PIM</b></p>
<p>I really liked Lintuniemi as a 17-year-old, and while he struggled initially in his 18-year-old season adjusting to North America, I still think he's a good prospect with a chance to get better. Lintuniemi uses his 6-3, 227-pound body well to win battles and regain puck possession. He had some issues defensively in the OHL, but I do think he has solid defensive projection as a physical, aware defender. He needs to work on his skating, and can make some bad decisions, but those can be corrected by the right NHL program.</p>
<p><b>97. Tanner MacMaster | C | Camrose (AJHL)<br>
DOB: 1/8/96 | 2013-14 stats: 48 GP, 11 G, 29 A, 62 PIM</b></p>
<p>MacMaster didn't have as strong a statistical season as hoped, but scouts aren't too worried, with one saying, "If he had better finishers, his points totals would've been better. He created chances but nobody would score." Tanner is a playmaker; he excels with the puck on his stick and in his best games, he can be a plus puck possessor. He's pretty small (5-10, 157 pounds), but works hard in battles and jetting up and down the ice. He has nice bursts in his step and good overall energy in his game. He's committed to Quinnipiac for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>98. Dominik Masin | D | HC Slavia Praha (Czech under-20)<br>
DOB: 2/1/96 | 2013-14 stats: 39 GP, 2 G, 19 A, 102 PIM</b></p>
<p>Masin is a strong two-way defenseman who has impressed at the international level, and was decent in league play, although he was his league's most penalized player. Masin is a heady defender who understands how to position himself on the ice, and anticipates the play well. His stick skills are decent, and his skating is about average as well.</p>
<p><b>99. Ivan Nikolishin | C | Everett (WHL)<br>
DOB: 4/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 18 G, 41 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>Nikolishin didn't have an outstanding season in his first campaign in North America, but he was still a pretty productive player, and one of the top scoring first-year draft-eligible forwards. His skill level is extremely impressive: Nikolishin has high-end hands and can dangle in a phone booth with his coordination. He understands how to create offensively with his natural offensive gifts, combined with above-average vision. He excels quarterbacking the power play. His major drawback is his size (around 5-9, 161 pounds) and being underdeveloped in terms of strength. He's a bit of a project or long shot, but has the tools to score if things panned out.</p>
<p><b>100. Shane Gersich | LW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 7/10/96| 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 16 G, 16 A, 18 PIM</b></p>
<p>Gersich is one of the better skaters in this draft, and while he's not an overly skilled player, his skating and intangibles make him an intriguing prospect. Gersich can be effective offensively because of how well he gains the zone. He speeds equally as fast on the back check, and fights for loose pucks. He can certainly make some plays offensively in open ice, although he's more of a secondary option.</p><p></p>
