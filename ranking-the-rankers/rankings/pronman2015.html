<p>Welcome to my second edition of the top 100 NHL draft prospect rankings at ESPN. The following is my analysis of the top prospects eligible to be selected in the 2015 NHL draft.</p>
<p>For a detailed explanation of my ranking methodology, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/12747773/prospect-ranking-methodology-2015-nhl-draft" target="new">click here</a>. Note that players are not separated into tiers, but there is a drop-off in talent that occurs after picks No. 1, 2, and 5, and a small drop-off at 20 before the marginal decrease in talent at each slot continues throughout the rankings.</p>
<p>From discussions throughout the year with scouts, I've heard this class described as a "super class," a simply "good" class and one that's "very average beyond the top two." I fall into the middle of those three.</p>
<p><offer></offer></p>
<p>The talent level of the players in my top 20 is very impressive, and when you go to No. 50 and look at these players' upsides, there are a lot of prospects that can excite an evaluator. However, there are notable concerns with many of the top prospects in the class. Top prospects such as Travis Konecny, Lawson Crouse and Pavel Zacha didn't have the counting numbers one would expect for their skill sets.</p>
<p>Evgeni Svechnikov, Daniel Sprong and Oliver Kylington are concerning away from the puck, while Jeremy Bracco, Nick Merkley, Anthony Beauvillier, Jeremy Roy and Mitchell Vande Sompel have question marks about their size.</p>
<p>Of course, the top two prospects in this class are special. Connor McDavid is the best prospect since <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3114/sidney-crosby">Sidney Crosby</a>. Jack Eichel likely would have been rated ahead of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3114717/aaron-ekblad">Aaron Ekblad</a>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2966500/nail-yakupov">Nail Yakupov</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2562624/ryan-nugent-hopkins">Ryan Nugent-Hopkins</a> in their draft years, although that last one is debatable.</p>
<p>To summarize, the best way I'd describe this draft class is: cautious optimism.</p>

<p><b>1. Connor McDavid<br>
C, Erie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 1/13/97 | Ht: 6-1 | Wt: 190<br>
2014-15 GP: 47 | G: 44 | A: 76</b></p>
<p>Get used to this name; he could end up as one of the faces of hockey for the next 10 to 20 years. McDavid is one of the best pure skaters I've ever seen. It's incredible how effortlessly he accelerates to an extremely dangerous full speed. At the CHL level, if a defenseman was horizontal to him or even had an inch gap they were beat, plain and simple. He'll step into the NHL next season and be one of his team's fastest players.</p>
<p>His puck skills are also of that same extremely high grade. He makes some of the most unique puck plays you'll see, to where it's hard to describe his puck skills other than to say "watch him." His creativity, hand-eye coordination, and balance are simply incredible. McDavid also has elite hockey sense, so on top of his knowing how to make defenders miss left and right and set up his teammates, this also lets him be an elite forechecker when combined with his skating. He follows the play off the puck so well that whenever he's on the ice -- even when the other team has the puck -- you're still expecting a McDavid scoring chance.</p>
<p>He's a relentless worker, and with that quality thrown in with some of his others, it makes him a very dangerous penalty killer as well. McDavid's sole real weakness is his frame right now, as bulking up will be a key for him to survive some of the NHL's physical hurdles.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/hockey_east.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>2. Jack Eichel<br>
C, Boston University (Hockey East)<br>
DOB: 10/28/96 | Ht: 6-2 | Wt: 194<br>
2014-15 GP: 40 | G: 26 | A: 45</b></p>
<p>Eichel is one of the very best college freshmen of the modern era, and had a simply fantastic season. His skill level is elite, and it's off the charts for a 6-2 forward in terms of the amount of high-level plays he makes regularly. Eichel uses a longer than average stick, and with his wingspan and skills he can be almost impossible to get off of the puck. He makes evasions seem effortless to where I often hear from scouts that he looks "bored" on the ice because he exerts so little energy when he makes defensemen miss.</p>
<p>He's strong, works hard and thinks the game at such a high level that he creates chances in bunches. His hockey sense allows him to be a top-end playmaker, but he's also a very good defensive forward, who has often been one of his team's top penalty killers. He skates very well with an explosive first few steps and a smooth glide you don't see often with bigger players. He projects as a potential No. 1 star center.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> The best way to describe the rationale for Eichel over Mitch Marner is that they share similar raw offensive qualities, but Eichel's size and more well-rounded game propel him over the latter. In terms of skating, puck skills and offensive IQ, they are very close. Maybe Marner has a small edge in one or two categories, but in size, Eichel is a 6-2, 200-pound center as opposed to Marner, who is 5-11, 175 pounds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Marner has shown solid defense, Eichel's defensive capabilities are very impressive for his age group. Some may point to Marner's incredible production in the OHL -- one of the best under-18 seasons in recent memory -- but Eichel's production is also of that same ludicrous level, especially when you account for the fact he's a late October birth date, putting him five to eight months behind where most freshmen tend to be physically.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>3. Mitch Marner<br>
C, London (OHL)<br>
DOB: 5/5/97 | Ht: 5-11 | Wt: 163<br>
2014-15 GP: 63 | G: 44 | A: 82</b></p>
<p>Marner had a fantastic 17-year-old season in the OHL, racking up an absurd amount of points. He's a shifty player, and is tough for a defense to stop. His speed, acceleration and edge control are all high-end, and because of that, you rarely saw an OHL defenseman land a clean check on Marner. His puck skills are elite, and he can make great in-tight plays to evade pressure, dekes in full stride to get around a defender or puck plays off the half-boards that create offense in bunches.</p>
<p>Marner is also an incredible passer, making quick reads with the ability to stretch the ice or move it across laterally through traffic with consistency. While small, his defensive game is solid, and improved quite notably over the course of the OHL season to where he became one of London's better penalty killers. He's also quite an effective forechecker, not in terms of physical play, but rather how well he forces plays and is sneaky on takeaways.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Marner and Dylan Strome were both among the very top scorers in the OHL this season, and both had under-18 seasons that were among the very best of the past 10 years in terms of statistical production.</p>
<p>It's a push in terms of pure hockey sense, although they're better in different ways: Marner is a little more creative and a little better in his defensive reads, while Strome's vision is probably a notch higher. Marner's skating is significantly better than Strome's especially in terms of speed, but Strome has a good four inches on Marner. Marner's production was aided by playing on a stacked London team, while Strome played with McDavid -- albeit typically just on the power play.</p>
<p>The skating difference is really what sways me, even with the size discrepancy, given their puck skills are close and Marner has shown he can defend. Skating kills in the NHL, in terms of being able to gain the zone with control of the puck, and Marner is ahead there.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>4. Dylan Strome<br>
C, Erie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 3/7/97 | Ht: 6-3 | Wt: 187<br>
2014-15 GP: 68 | G: 45 | A: 84</b></p>
<p>Strome was one of the very top scorers in the OHL this season, and while many point to the teammate effect with McDavid on the same team, he didn't play with him much at even strength, yet still managed a roughly 1.5 points-per-game pace when McDavid was hurt.</p>
<p>"He's a big center with high-end skill. You're never going to find that anywhere but the top of the draft" said one scout.</p>
<p>Strome is a great stick handler, especially for a 6-3 player, but he's also smart with the puck. He slows the play down very well, operates well in tight spaces and has the offensive instincts to evade pressure at a high level. He's not great defensively yet, although he's fine on the draw and could project to have decent defensive value down the line.</p>
<p>Strome's main weakness is his skating, as he lacks an explosive top gear and is just roughly average in that area overall.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> The ranking of Marner and Strome ahead of Noah Hanifin was <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/nhl-draft/post?id=744" target="new">discussed in depth</a> here.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/hockey_east.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>5. Noah Hanifin<br>
D, Boston College (Hockey East)<br>
DOB: 1/25/97 | Ht: 6-2 | Wt: 205<br>
2014-15 GP: 37 | G: 5 | A: 18</b></p>
<p>Hanifin is an elite all-around defenseman who has a real chance to be in the NHL next season should he choose to leave Boston College. He's a high-end skater who moves incredibly well for a player of his size. His first few steps are explosive, with as much power out of his pivots and crossovers as you'll see in a defenseman, making him very dangerous in transition.</p>
<p>His puck skills and offensive IQ don't blow you away, but he's very good in those areas. Hanifin can make the quick passes, lead a rush in a dynamic way and makes good decisions with the puck.</p>
<p>Defensively, he closes his gaps well, uses his stick effectively and projects as a player who can stop good forwards. Overall, his game is a high-tempo, high-energy style, though he's not the most bruising defender.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Despite the positional differences and the value it gives Mathew Barzal, overall there is a talent drop-off here. Hanifin's accomplishments during the past two years have been extremely impressive, and it's only because of the incredible seasons of the four players ranked ahead of him that he's slotted No. 5.</p>
<p>On pure talent, Barzal is not too far away from Hanifin. They're both elite skaters, Barzal is better with the puck, and both are very smart. However, Hanifin has a major size edge, and is very good defensively. At the end of the day, output wins out. As an under-18 defenseman in Hockey East, Hanifin has been spectacular, and he was impressive as a double underage at the IIHF World Junior Championships. Barzal's talent level is high-end, and I love the upside, but he just doesn't have the same resume, as he was pretty good but not amazing in 2014-15.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/whl.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>6. Mathew Barzal<br>
C, Seattle (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/26/97 | Ht: 6-0 | Wt: 181<br>
2014-15 GP: 44 | G: 12 | A: 45</b></p>
<p>In prospect circles, Barzal has been a name in discussion for most of this decade as he came up through the Bantam ranks. The former first overall WHL pick is an exciting and well-rounded prospect with significant upside. He's one of the best skaters in this draft class, with an explosive first step, high-end top speed and his edge work that is among the most impressive of his age group.</p>
<p>Barzal's skill level is also pretty good, with his vision and playmaking being standout attributes. He's patient, creative, and shifty with the puck. He succeeds in many different ways, whether it is off the rush with pace, a quick no-look pass from the cycle, or by making a defenseman miss.</p>
<p>He's not an incredibly physical player, but shows great energy and effort on the ice at both ends. He is often one of his team's top scoring-chance creators and penalty killers.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:&nbsp;</b>Both players are highly skilled, right-handed centers with great character. Konecny's impressed me more when they've played on the same ice, but he's been hurt more often, too. Konecny's overall production during his CHL career has been more impressive, but Barzal arguably was more so this season. I leaned Barzal due to the small gap in skill and seeing more upside.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>7. Travis Konecny<br>
C, Ottawa (OHL)<br>
DOB: 3/11/97 | Ht: 5-10 | Wt: 172<br>
2014-15 GP: 60 | G: 29 | A: 39</b></p>
<p>Konecny's season started a little slow, but his offense picked up as the campaign went along, and the former No. 1 pick in the OHL draft remains a top-end prospect. He's an explosive skater who jets through the neutral zone with the best in the CHL. He darts well in small spaces, and he can turn defensemen's hips with his straight-line speed.</p>
<p>Konecny is small and doesn't win a ton of battles, but he is tough, and he plays a fearless style of hockey where he drives the net and gets involved physically. He's a very skilled puck handler, who can make defenders miss. He's also a very smart offensive player who is more than just a pure dangler. He sees the ice very well and makes a lot of great reads. He also has fine defensive value, and could project onto a pro-level penalty kill if he handles the physical grind.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> The explanation here is similar to Hanifin vs. Barzal, but the degrees are not as severe; thus, Konecny's talent and positional value win out against Zach Werenski. Werenski's offensive capabilities are very impressive, but unlike Hanifin, he's not as dynamic defensively. He's arguably a little better with the puck than Hanifin, and a high-end skater.</p>
<p>These differences matter when pressed against Konecny's great offensive tools. Werenski's NCAA performance was very unique for an under-18 player, almost as good as Hanifin, although he hasn't looked as impressive during international play. The call here is close, but my philosophy is that when the call is close, go with the forward, especially a right-handed center!</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa_conf/500/big_ten.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>8. Zach Werenski<br>
D, Michigan (Big Ten)<br>
DOB: 7/19/97 | Ht: 6-2 | Wt: 214<br>
2014-15 GP: 35 | G: 9 | A: 16</b></p>
<p>Werenski was incredible this season, and was arguably Michigan's best defenseman despite being 17 years old.</p>
<p>"He's smooth as silk" said one scout; with another saying "he makes everything look easy."</p>
<p>His skating won't blow you away, but he's certainly above average, with power out of his first step, good edges and footwork. Werenski is at the top of his game when he has the puck, whether it's on an outlet, bringing it up on the rush or controlling a power play. He makes a ton of plays offensively and never looks panicked when doing so.</p>
<p>He's pretty developed physically already, measuring in at 6-2 and 214 pounds, although he's not a very physical player. His defense isn't poor, in fact I'd say it's better than average, but he can get caught making mistakes in his positional play. He's a potential top-four D-man, who can also be a first-unit power-play option.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> While this may be seem like semantics -- and often outside of a "tier" that's what one-on-one rankings end up being -- the reasons for taking Werenski over Mathew Barzal is a matter of degrees relative to the Konecny vs. Werenski ranking explanation.</p>
<p>The main difference is that while Svechnikov's skill set is of a very high degree, it is just not as high as Konecny's, and thus tilts the scale towards the defenseman Werenski. His skating and vision are around the same level, and his off-the-puck game somewhat better, but his pure skill and offensive creativity are not at the same level of Konecny. Thus, when you consider the merits of Weresnki's game, and his incredible production with Michigan, it tilts the scale in his favor.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/qmjhl.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>9. Evgeni Svechnikov<br>
LW, Cape Breton (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 10/31/96 | Ht: 6-3 | Wt: 205<br>
2014-15 GP: 55 | G: 32 | A: 46</b></p>
<p>Svechnikov has been a top prospect in the Russian program for a number of years, and had an impressive first season in North America. He's a 6-2 forward with a ton of talent who effectively switched to center in the latter months of the season. He's very shifty in tight, and can make lightning-quick moves to evade pressure. Svechnikov also uses his big frame well to protect the puck and doesn't shy away from putting physical pressure on his opponents. He sees the ice well, and has good touch on all his passes.</p>
<p>His skating isn't a standout attribute, but he skates at a solid to average level, which makes him stand out as a bigger player. His defense is a notable "work in progress," and he doesn't at all seem like a player you're projecting into tough defensive roles as an NHLer. His upside is top-end, as you don't often see his combination of size, puck skills and offensive IQ.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> I discussed Lawson Crouse as a prospect <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/nhl-draft/insider/post?id=709" target="_blank">in length here</a> in terms of what gets him into this range of players. In terms of the particularities of Crouse vs. Svechnikov, Crouse is a better skater. He's not worlds better, but the manner in which Crouse moves is more impressive than Svechnikov, especially in terms of straight-line speed. Crouse is elite in terms of his physical play and defense, as opposed to Svechnikov being just good in the former and sub-par in the latter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Svechnikov is much better in terms of puck skills, offensive IQ and vision. I lean Svechnikov because with wide differences in offensive play for one and defensive play with the other, the offensive skill is more enticing in projecting a player, especially at the forward position.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>10. Lawson Crouse<br>
LW, Kingston (OHL)<br>
DOB: 6/23/97 | Ht: 6-4 | Wt: 212<br>
2014-15 GP: 56 | G: 29 | A: 22</b></p>
<p>Crouse is a player with fantastic physical gifts, and despite a lack of amazing statistical production, he's consistently impressive. He's an outstanding skater for a 6-4 forward and will be an above-average skater at the NHL level. Given his large body mass, the way he gets up to his top gear so quickly is a standout attribute of his game.</p>
<p>Crouse plays a tough brand of hockey, supplemented by his filled-out frame, and he projects as an elite physical player in the NHL. Crouse is very advanced defensively for an under-18 prospect, showing very good defensive awareness and penalty-killing skills. He's not a standout offensively, but he's above average in terms of puck skills and offensive ability; he just doesn't show it consistently. I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of offensive IQ, or not yet being comfortable playing that kind of game. But, I've seen him make high-level plays, the points will come.</p><p></p>

<p>Zacha's season was a little up and down, as he lost time due to injuries and performed pretty well, but was somewhat below expectations considering he's been a highly touted prospect for the past few years. All the tools point in the right direction for Zacha. He's a big, strong forward who uses his body well to win battles and deliver hits. He's a fantastic skater for a big man. His technique is very refined, he's good in tight spaces, and can explode through the neutral zone.</p>
<p>He's also a pretty skilled playmaker who shows skilled, coordinated puck handling and the vision to make plays. Zacha's shot is notably above average, with a ton of torque behind it. He'll need to improve his defensive positioning, but he does show effort to come back on D.</p>

<p>Rantanen had as good a second half as any prospect in this year's class, with a great World Juniors, and carried one of <a href="https://twitter.com/coreypronman/status/568166368262164480" target="new">the worst teams</a> in the Liiga this season despite being under 19. Rantanen is a big-bodied, 6-foot-4 forward with tremendous skill for a player his size. His hands are above average to high end, with the offensive creativity to make tough plays. Rantanen is a good playmaker who can make some impressive passes and flash top-end ability in that area.</p>
<p>He's not an overly physical player, but on occasion he'll drive the net and make the most of his size; unfortunately, that doesn't happen as much as you'd hope. His skating is roughly average, maybe a tick below out of the gate, although I've heard some Finnish scouts say they're not too concerned there. Rantanen's defense showed improvements this season, but that area could also use some work.</p>

<p>Connor has had multiple All-Star-caliber seasons in the USHL, and is the top prospect to come out of that league this season. He plays the game with energy and pace, and is a fantastic skater with a little giddy-up in his step. He comes barreling down the wing, and puts pressure on defensemen with his speed. His hockey IQ and his skating allow him to be an effective defensive forward as well.</p>
<p>He's not especially great as a dangler, but he's definitely above average in the puck skills category, with very quick hands. He likes getting to the net, and is the kind of player to get the puck on the sideboards, make a move to make a defender miss, and either drive the puck to the crease or get a shot on goal.</p>

<p>Provorov is a very skilled and advanced defenseman who has shown a strong commitment to North America, having played on this side of the Atlantic for the past four seasons. He's a very gifted skater with good agility and power out of his stride. Mechanically, he isn't perfect -- he has an awkward lean-over skating style -- but the end result looks promising, with room to improve. He's above average as an offensive player, with good puck skills and great ability to find lanes and move the puck.</p>
<p>He's slightly undersized for a defenseman, but he's decent-to-solid in his own end, with good angles, positioning and stick work. There are times when his defensive zone play shows a read error, but overall, he makes enough stops to be reliable at even strength.</p>

<p>Kylington's season was a little bumpy due to reassignments and injury, but overall, it was very impressive considering the high level at which he played in tough, pro leagues. He's a brilliant skater who gains speed easily, and has the four-way movements to stay with quick forwards. Kylington is a very skilled puck handler, who makes a lot of creative plays and controls the puck in tight spaces as well as the best forwards in this class. He stretches the ice well, and can control a power play very effectively. His offensive IQ and vision are high-end, and his total package offensively can create chances out of nowhere and control the game.</p>
<p>He has his warts, however, as he isn't the best in the physical aspects of the game in terms of effort or his frame, and his shot could be better. His defense isn't perfect, but it isn't bad. If anything I'd project him to be about average defensively, while being a top-end offensive defenseman.</p>

<p>Bracco is an exciting -- albeit very small -- winger who can take over a game. He's a high-end skater with great agility, acceleration and ability to push the pace on exits and entries. When you combine his skating with his very high skill level, he's a nightmare for defenders to check. He's very coordinated, and draws your attention with the way he creates offense out of nothing. Scouts refer to him as an "assist machine" due to his talent level and his very creative playmaking style.</p>
<p>Bracco is quite solid defensively, and in my viewings has been effective killing penalties and as a short-handed scoring threat. His 5-foot-9 frame is an obvious drawback, especially since he's not an overly abrasive type of player.</p>

<p>I can't say how tough it was for me to put Sprong this "low," even though I suspect he'll go lower on draft day. A part of me wanted to get him into my top 10. Sprong put up a lot of points this season, and while he wasn't among the very top scorers in the QMJHL, he is one of the most dynamic players in the league. Whichever team drafts him, Sprong will become a favorite of that fan base because he's so fun to watch. He's an explosive skater who can push the tempo very well and has smooth mechanics to generate a lot of power from each stride.</p>
<p>He has a high skill level with the puck, making a lot of difficult plays and displaying good coordination. He sees the ice well and regularly sets up chances for his teammates. He also has a very good shot, generating a lot of torque through his windups. Sprong needs to bulk up, work on his defense a bit, and gain more consistency in his play. His upside is fantastic, though, and if he ends up as one of the best players from this class, I would not be at all surprised.</p>

<p>Merkley had a very impressive season as one of the WHL's top scorers. He's a high-end offensive weapon who can make a wide variety of plays to generate scoring chances, and is a dynamic puck handler with very soft hands and a high level of creativity. Merkley makes plays in tight spaces and at a very quick pace. He's a very flashy player -- arguably at times trying to be too fancy -- but overall the tempo at which he plays makes him very dangerous.</p>
<p>In games I've seen, he's looked like just an above-average skater, but several scouts I talk to describe him as great in that area. His 5-foot-11 frame isn't ideal, but he works hard in puck battles, has a fine strength level and seems to have the character components to overcome his size. His defensive play has also shown immense improvements from 12 months ago.</p>

<p>Roy has been a top prospect for years, and has consistently displayed his very impressive offensive upside. He's also the rare right-handed defenseman who plays the left side with higher frequency. He's a very good skater in all directions, with nice edge work and a quality top gear. His puck skills are clearly above average, and he's a coordinated puck handler who can lead a rush with ease.</p>
<p>His puck movement is high-end, as he thinks quickly, is creative and doesn't force plays. Roy is slightly undersized and could tighten his gaps defensively at times, but he makes some defensive stops and battles well.</p>

<p>Cernak has also been a very impressive prospect for some time, being one of Slovakia's top under-18 products of the past 10-15 years. He has a ton of high-level experience, including a great season in Slovakia's top league and playing for the national squad. His tool kit is extremely appealing, and he has a raw upside that's sky high: He projects to skate and handle the puck at above-average NHL levels.</p>
<p>Cernak is also a physical defender who can make defensive stops as well as play a part on a team's power play. His main issue is his hockey IQ, as he shows a moderate frequency to make bad decisions on hits, pinches and puck decisions. At the top of his game, he can look like a dominant two-way defenseman, but that is not always the guy who shows up.</p><p></p>

<p>A former top pick in the QMJHL draft, Shawnigan had a very good second season in the league, finishing among the top under-18 scorers in all of the CHL. Beauvillier's main weakness is his size, as he measured in at 5-10, but other than that, he's a pretty well-rounded prospect. He's a decent defensive center who is good on draws and displays a high-end work ethic at both ends of the rink. Beauvillier plays with energy, drives the net and engages physically.</p>
<p>He's an above-average skater, who can gain the zone effectively by pushing the defenders back on their gaps. He's not an overly flashy player -- and I've never seen him dominate a game -- but he's always making plays. He's certainly got puck skills, but his best trait is his hockey IQ. He sees the play unfolding very well and sets up chances with his patience and vision. He also has a pretty good shot.</p>

<p>After coming in to his draft season as a top-15 prospect, White's season didn't unfold quite as well as he'd have liked because of several ailments, but he still managed to pull off a fine campaign. White's standout attribute is his hockey sense.</p>
<p>"He has so many little details to his game" said one scout, "he makes smart plays all over the ice."</p>
<p>White is a smooth, quiet player that gets a lot done. He sees the ice at a high level, he's creative, but isn't overly flashy with the puck, and rarely makes mistakes. White is very good defensively, often being the kind of player who is leaned on to kill penalties and take critical defensive zone draws. His skating is what one scout describes as "deceptively quick," in that he won't jet down the wing, but he can get to a good top gear and doesn't labor around the ice.</p>

<p>Stephens isn't the tallest guy, but he was a top player for Saginaw this season and played well at the Ivan Hlinka tournament and under-18 world championships. He really turned his season around in the past few months of the season. Speed and pace define Stephens' game, as he's a fantastic skater whose speed is high-end. Stephens' stride generates so much power, he looks like he's gliding over the ice at times.</p>
<p>He has great work ethic on the ice, battling through checks well, getting to the net, and coming back on defense with tenacity. Stephens kills off penalties pretty well and exhibits a lot of energy on the ice. He plays a fast yet smart game, as he makes fine decisions with the puck and can set up plays. He's not overly skilled, but he can certainly create some offense by himself.</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever seen a single game from Harkins in which he completely dominated, but the former No. 2 overall pick in the WHL bantam draft consistently performed at both ends of the rink on a team from which he didn't get much support. His hockey sense is his best trait, as he is patient, anticipates the play well, has good vision and is creative with the puck. He has the pure skill level to score, as well as the grit and frame to kill penalties effectively.</p>
<p>His skating isn't a giant hole in his game, but his stride is a little awkward, with less than ideal extensions through his push-offs as he bends over in an odd way, although his straightaway speed isn't an issue.</p>

<p>Vande Sompel had a very interesting season. For the most part, he was Oshawa's top defenseman, but when needed, he actually shifted to be the team's top line <em>center</em>. That's unique versatility, as he played forward all season on the penalty kill, so as they say in baseball, NHL teams might be able to "move him off the position" if teams are worried about his 5-10 frame on defense.</p>
<p>He's a great skater, with quick, active feet and the speed to gain the zone with ease. He shows the comfort leading the play and attacking, as one would imagine for a player who grew up a forward. He's skilled (though not amazingly so) with the puck. However, Vande Sompel is at a very high level in terms of his hockey IQ. He's quite advanced defensively given his development track and quite effective positionally for a smaller player. His upside is tantalizing.</p>

<p>Meier had a pretty successful second season in North America, racking up a lot of points in Halifax. He's a versatile forward in that he can play center and the wing and can play on both special teams. Meier has a pro-sized frame, skates and handles the puck at above-average levels and can play with pace.</p>
<p>His ability to play either a speed, skill or power game makes him very appealing, especially since he shows a commitment to get back into the defensive zone. Scouts have noted that he can get tunnel vision with the puck at times, and overall he's not a true standout offensive talent. But he does a lot well and has a fair amount of NHL potential.</p>

<p>Andersson has been one of the hardest prospects to pin down this season. If you told me two years ago Andersson would not be in my top 15, I'd have called you crazy. But there are enough red flags in his game to warrant some skepticism.</p>
<p>He's a dynamic offensive talent with great puck skills, especially for a player with a pro-sized frame. He has an aggressive, attacking style of play and loves to have the puck on his stick. In terms of power-play skills, his combination of IQ, skill and a big shot makes him one of the top offensive defensemen in the class. The red flags are his lackluster defensive play in terms of his off-puck reads, up-and-down effort levels, being too aggressive offensively and his habit of getting beat with speed at times.</p>

<p>Aho had a fine season, including lengthy stints in Finland's top league, playing in the top nine for Finland at the WJC and excelling during under-18 tournaments. He skates pretty well, and while he doesn't have blazing speed, it's certainly above average and enough to pressure defensemen off the rush. He's a very skilled and smart offensive player who won't make overly flashy plays but makes quick, creative decisions and moves the puck very well. His vision is high-end and can be a real threat on the power play.</p>
<p>Aho's hockey IQ translates well to defense, where he's shown during international play he can be quite effective, even when playing ahead of his age group. The main issue with Aho is his physical game. He's 5-11, 170 pounds and doesn't engage as much or as well as you'd hope someone would with his frame.</p>

His work ethic is strong, and that helps him cover a lot of ice. DeBrusk is a very skilled playmaker who can make the soft-touch plays to his teammates, as well as create chances for himself.</p>

<p>Kase had a very interesting season, playing all year in the Czech second division, and while he didn't put up great numbers considering the quality of that league, he was impressive in international play. Other than his size and physical game, Kase's game is positive in almost every other aspect.</p>
<p>He's a quick, shifty skater who can lead a rush and is elusive in tight spaces. He's a great playmaker, who can dictate the play on the man advantage with his skill and vision. He also shows the willingness and hockey IQ to be an effective defensive player; as he gains strength, that aspect of his game should improve even more. He hasn't really produced gaudy numbers, but on a scouting level, I think he's looked fantastic at times and has the ability to be a potential home run for the team that lands him.</p><p></p>

He's a good physical player, with a bulky 6-foot-1 frame and a great work ethic. Boeser is strong on the puck in battles to help maintain possession, and he goes to the net with consistency. He has one of the better shots in this draft class and gets it off quickly with zip.</p>
<p>While he's skilled, he's not an overly flashy player; he's more of a read-and-react player, who also has solid hand-eye coordination. His skating is about average and leans to being a little below that mark; it's not a huge liability, but he could gain an extra step. His defense also could use some work.</p>

<p>Malgin has been a top prospect in Switzerland's program for a number of years, having already played more than 20 international games and two full seasons of pro hockey. He's a pretty good skater, and though not a tremendous blazer, he is very shifty with great edge work and an above-average top gear. His puck skills are fantastic, as Malgin can make offense out of nothing with his creative hockey mind and threaten off the rush.</p>
<p>He's a very good passer who can make a lot of tough dishes but can also try to be too fancy at times. Generally, he's a very dangerous offensive player with a lot of upside. He's small, and his fringe physical game restricts him, especially since he's not great defensively. He plays center currently, but I could see him pushed off to the wing as a North American pro.</p>

<p>Novak had a pretty good rookie USHL season, in which he hovered around the point-per-game mark, and there were many games in which he was dominant and just didn't capitalize. He was the leading scorer at the Ivan Hlinka tournament and was second in scoring at the Junior-A challenge. Novak has a very high skill level. He's very coordinated and creative with the puck, and he makes a lot of high-difficulty plays and creates scoring chances in bunches.</p>
<p>He's a quick, elusive skater with good jump in his step, though one NHL scouted noted that his short legs keep him from exploding through the neutral zone. He needs to bulk up and work on his defense a fair amount, but he is a player with great offensive touch and has high upside.</p>

<p>Guryanov had a pretty good season -- scoring around a point per game in the Russian junior league and getting a stint in the KHL, on top of good international performances. He is an explosive skater and gets the highest of grades in terms of pure skating ability for a player his size. He pushes the pace very well and can be a lot to handle for defenders on the rush. He combines that with a pretty impressive skill level, as he creates a lot of chances with his hands and vision.</p>
<p>His decisions with the puck aren't always great, but he does get involved a lot on offense. Guryanov is also a solid finisher, flashing an above-average shot. Guryanov gets pretty involved in the physical play and at times might even push the limits in that regard, in terms of penalty trouble. He's not a defensive stalwart, but he's solid in his own end -- closing on his checks effectively -- and has penalty-killing skills on top of being a shorthanded scoring threat.</p>

<p>Spacek had a pretty impressive season for an under-18 forward in the Czech Republic's top league, as he put up 12 points in 40 games playing against men. He's a flashy and exciting offensive player who regularly shows the ability to make high-difficulty plays. Spacek sees the ice at a very high level, which makes him dangerous when he sets up with space, as he frequently finds his linemates for scoring chances.</p>
<p>He's an agile skater who can be quite elusive and make defenders miss. He's not a blazer in terms of his top gear, but he's above-average there. Spacek plays the game with energy and good work ethic, but overall, his physical game is less than impressive, and he doesn't look all that imposing when he engages in puck battles. His defensive positioning could use work, with his frame not helping him in that regard.</p>

<p>Carlo had a fine second season in the WHL and was on USA's under-20 team in a decent role as well. Carlo is a big defenseman who plays a tough brand of hockey and can defend at even strength and on the PK quite well, using his size to get in lanes and clear the net. He has solid enough hockey sense and can anticipate some of the faster plays, and he knows how to transition the puck.</p>
<p>His skating isn't fantastic, as his stride can be a little short, but overall, he moves well for a big guy and has the puck skills to get up into the attack. He could curtail some of the mistakes he makes, especially on forcing offensive plays, and continue to fill out his massive frame. He projects as a defensive defenseman with a small chance at bringing offense too. I've also seen him play his off-wing side somewhat effectively.</p>

<p>The Czech native was very good in his rookie Q season after crossing the pond. He played all situations for the Sea Dogs and got better as the season went along. Zboril has a pretty well-rounded style but doesn't have one particular elite skill.</p>
<p>"He's a great skater who carries the puck well," one NHL scout said, while another stated, "He's got a great physical game and can make plays in his own end."</p>
<p>His footwork is very clean, with an easy stride and the power to get up in the rush. Zboril doesn't have standout puck skills, but he's a very calm and efficient passer who makes plays when under pressure. He uses his frame well to win battles and box out forwards and still has room to fill out. Defensively, he shows solid value. His positioning and reads aren't perfectly tweaked yet, as I've seen him get beat a little too much, but he makes stops and can kill penalties at a fine level.</p>

<p>Like Zboril, Dergachev's play picked up as the season went along, which ended with his making a bit of a surprise appearance in Russia's top nine at the WJC. He's a two-way center with size, and this makes him a very appealing prospect. He's not going to dominate a power play, but his skill level is above average, with good hand-eye coordination for a player of his size.</p>
<p>His offensive IQ is solid. He'll set up chances for his linemates and understands his position well. Dergachev is pretty good on defense and can handle tough assignments. He uses his big frame well to protect the puck, win battles and drive the net. He also fills lanes well on the penalty kill. His skating isn't great overall, and I'd peg his speed at about average.</p>

<p>Forsbacka-Karlsson, or JFK, as I call him (think that nickname will stick?), has been on the prospect radar for many years, and though I don't think I've ever seen him flat-out dominate a game, he almost always shows a very reliable all-around performance.</p>
<p>He's one of the best defensive forwards available in this year's class. He is great at faceoffs, gets in lanes pretty well and exhibits great work ethic. He will at times show the offensive ability to be a real creator, but that is not a very consistent element of his game, and he projects more as a tough-minutes, middle-six type of player. He does have fine skating and skill but probably lacks the offensive instinct and creativity to be a difference-maker at the pro level.</p>
<p>"The offensive upside is the biggest question with him: Can he score as a pro?" one NHL head scout wondered.</p><p></p>

<p>At one point, Roy was thought to be a sure-fire elite NHL prospect, and while he hasn't had that kind of season, he still remains a desirable player with a lot of ability. Six-foot-four forwards with great skill don't grow on trees (I checked,) and that's especially true of ones like Roy who are committed to playing a 200-foot game. He makes unique plays because of his giant frame and how he can maintain puck possession. His hockey sense is very high in terms of how he sees the ice, anticipates how to create chances and reads defensive cues.</p>
<p>Roy is a decent skater, fine for his size, but has a bit of a low-energy style in which he isn't fully exerting his stride; his first few steps could also use work. He'll win battles, but he should win more for a player with his frame. He's a high-risk, high-reward prospect.</p>

<p>The "other" Sebastian Aho is a very talented player with high-end skating and hockey sense. His ability to process the game at such a high level with his creativity and two-way reads makes him an impact player -- at times. He's a skilled puck handler who moves the puck well and can make defensive stops. His defensive play isn't perfect, but he has shown ability in his own end and on the penalty kill despite his size.</p>
<p>One of the biggest surprises of the 2014 draft was watching every eligible defenseman on Sweden's under-18 team get drafted -- except for their best one in Aho. I get the argument against him: He's 5-9. Sure, it's a problem, but it's not a problem that should make one ignore everything else about his game. There's no guarantee Aho will play at a high level as a North American pro, but I think he's done more than enough to prove he's a real prospect -- he deserves a shot.</p>

<p>I'm lower on Bittner than the industry, but it's hard to ignore that he has some appealing characteristics. He's 6-4, but skates like he's 5-11. His skating mechanics are very smooth, and he can be a handful on the rush due to his speed and frame. Bittner isn't a pure dangler, but he doesn't have rock hands, either. His shot is arguably high end, as it comes off the tape with scorching velocity and he can locate it well.</p>
<p>His hockey sense is bit of a question mark, in that he makes some odd decisions, but he shows good vision and creates scoring chances. Bittner's defensive play could also use some tweaks, but he shows effort and average reads. He could be a scoring power forward in the NHL if his development goes well.</p>

<p>Eriksson played a good chunk of this season in the SHL, and also played very well in the top Swedish junior circuit. He's a very versatile player and is a low-risk type of prospect. Eriksson's hockey IQ is his best trait.</p>
<p>"He's so smart, always in the right place and never makes a mistake with the puck," said one scout.</p>
<p>I wouldn't classify him as a dominant player, but whether he's playing in front of the net on the power play, creating from the side boards, killing off penalties, checking good players, taking a key draw, or being the extra man when the team needs a goal, coaches always can rely on Eriksson. His puck skills are solid, and his skating is about average, with his straight-line speed being stronger than his edges and bursts.</p>

<p>Chabot had a very quality second campaign in the Q, especially when Saint John's defensive depth was tested and he was asked to step into a bigger role. He's a very gifted skater who can outlet the puck well and is very dangerous off the rush. Chabot has impressive overall hockey IQ, especially offensively, as he sees the ice very well and is able to control the tempo.</p>
<p>His value is certainly offensively tilted, as he loves to join the attack and stretch the ice with his passes. But, he's not entirely one-dimensional, as he can make some defensive stops, is physical and can be effective on the penalty kill. He'll need to continue to develop his defensive play, but he could be a two-way defenseman as a pro.</p>

Chlapik is a skilled playmaker who displays very good hockey sense. His hand-eye coordination and stick skills are impressive, but he's more at home when he gets time to be patient and find ways to make plays.</p>
<p>His frame is pretty sturdy, and he shows a good power game in terms of puck protection and battling in the tough spaces. I've heard some scouts praise his defensive game, and while it's certainly fine, I don't give him as high a grade there yet. His skating is a hole right now. His speed is roughly average and his stride is a little awkward in terms of his push-offs.</p>

<p>Siegenthaler has already played two full seasons of pro hockey in Switzerland before his 18th birthday between their A and B division, on top of a ton of international hockey. He's very physically mature already -- at 6-3, 220 pounds -- and has shown he can handle physicality playing against men and projects to be potentially high-end in that area in North America.</p>
<p>Siegenthaler is a great skater for a player his size, showing good four-way mobility and an ability to get into the attack. He moves the puck well, displaying decent to solid offensive skill with fine vision on outlets and on the power play. Siegenthaler is solid defensively due to his feet and physical play. His reads in both ends could use some work, as he can get caught with his gaps not being controlled well or coughing up the puck too often. His hockey sense is not a huge issue, but it's not great either.</p>

<p>I haven't been blown away by Meloche in any game this season, but he's consistently impressed in most games. He's an above-average skater who closes his gaps very well on his checks. He can activate into the attack, but he's not a super aggressive player in that aspect.</p>
<p>However, Meloche is a very aggressive physical player who delivers punishing hits. He can kill penalties, though he could fix a read or two in his positioning; but, he makes defensive plays. Meloche is a solid puck mover and he gets a ton of shots through to goal due to his shooting skills and his hockey IQ. He projects as an all-situations defenseman.</p>

<p>His skating is above average and arguably plus. He's also quite skilled with the puck, but what stands out is his hockey IQ. He's a creative offensive player in terms of one-on-one moves and creating for his linemates. He's not a fantastic defensive player but has value in his own end. If he isn't 5-9, I think you're talking about a very well-rounded player (and one who'd be drafted higher); instead, one has to wonder how much his size issues will limit him. I think he's answered a lot of those questions this season in a positive way.</p>

<p>He's not a blazer, but is an above-average skater with a good first step. He works hard in one-on-one battles and wins a lot of them due to his effort and size.

He is a very shifty player, who makes the game at a quick tempo and can make great in-tight plays. He's a fine skater, and is technically sound with above-average speed. Looke is average off the puck, but he can make some plays in that area and win some battles despite not being overly physical. His reads aren't always perfect, as he can force some decisions.</p>

<p>Pilipenko didn't really get much exposure in major events this season, so truth be told, this ranking is more based on his extremely impressive 17-year-old season. He's got one of the bigger upsides out of the players who will go outside the top 45-60 picks. Pilipenko's offensive skill is high-end, with the creativity and offensive IQ to make unique plays and create scoring chances. His skating is good, not great, and he's not too explosive for a smaller forward. His vision is solid, but he'll make his money by making players miss and being a finisher with the puck. Pilipenko's all-around game also needs some fine-tuning; his physical game isn't too impressive and his defensive game needs significant work.</p>

He's a very good skater, and though he isn't as high-end with his puck skills, that area is still pretty good. He's also a smart two-way player. Roslovic sees the ice well, with the ability to make the difficult distributions. He also has some dazzle to his game, and will on occasion execute a rush that draws the attention of the crowd. He could stand to bulk up, as he's not all that intimidating in the physical game. Consistency of effort is also a flaw in the view of some scouts.</p>

<p>The former sixth overall pick in his WHL bantam draft is a very good skater, and has one of the best size/speed ratios in the class. He plays the game with intensity, and has physical abilities that can make him a force. Gropp is strong on the puck, and can flash a top-end wrist shot as well. I'm not sold on his hockey IQ as of now. He can kill penalties well, but that's less due to his anticipation and more about his frame, speed and intangibles. His decisions and pace just overall don't look too impressive at the moment, and he's more of a player who goes out and gives it his all without playing within too much structure.</p>

He's got a lot of physical tools, moves effortlessly in all directions and evades pressure pretty well for a big guy. He's not an overly gifted puck mover, but has solid to above-average skill. Defensively, Larsson can make some stops. He uses his body well to win battles and shows good effort in battles. He's not great in his own end, as he could clean up his reads, reactions and overall positioning. His skating allows him to make up for some errors.</p>

He doesn't have elite puck skills, but he's pretty coordinated and creative, maintains possession well and makes tough plays. His offensive IQ is a very impressive trait. I've seen flashes of above-average skating, but he's not that explosive out of the gate. Fischer can be very effective when he drives the net and uses his body, but his physical game is somewhat inconsistent. His defensive play ticked up as the season went along, but that probably won't be his calling card as a pro.</p>

<p>Saarela came into the season as a top-30 prospect after impressing in his 15- and 16-year-old seasons. However, while he played well generally, he underwhelmed at times, hence the drop. He's a very skilled puck handler and playmaker, and can evade pressure effectively due to his skill and lower-body strength. He's a very smart player in traffic, who makes the in-tight plays and has a scorer's instinct. His off-puck game needs work, as his defense and physical effort aren't the best.</p>

<p>I was really high on Wotherspoon coming into the season, thinking he may have had the potential to even go in the first round. He didn't have that strong of a showing in 2014-15, but there's still a lot to like with him. Wotherspoon is a good skater; his edges are great, and he can be very tough to get a handle on by forecheckers. He is creative, and sees plays developing well offensively. He's about average in the defensive end, as he shows some impressive reads but gets beat a little too often. Wotherspoon will get involved physically, but his frame betrays him in one-on-one battles. He's probably going to be more effective with his stick checks than physical play as a pro.</p>

<p>A former fourth overall pick in his QMJHL draft, Carrier is a pretty talented prospect, though as you'd expect for someone at No. 59 overall here, he is not without flaws. Carrier is skilled puck mover with great overall hockey sense. He controls a power play quite effectively, and makes quick decisions. He's small for a defenseman, but still makes defensive plays in terms of his stick positioning and overall anticipation. His skating isn't too strong, and combined with his size, doesn't help his defensive projection going forward, as the size and ability of his opponents will improve drastically.</p>

<p>Kovacs led Sweden's second-division circuit in goals and points by an under-20 player, and was also the leading scorer on his pro team. He plays a fast-tempo type of game with his above-average to high-end speed, and great work ethic. He shows a tendency to play the body and plays the game with an edge. At times, he could stand to slow the game down or show better creativity and decision-making, but to his credit, he's made it work so far in pro hockey playing an aggressive, north-south type of game.</p><p></p>

<p>Korostelev is a Russian-born prospect who came up the amateur ranks in Ontario, and has had two straight solid campaigns in the OHL. He's a pretty good physical forward with a filled-out frame, and he displays a strong power game with the puck. Korostelev can play a perimeter game as well as the inside game due to his impressive hands and vision. He also has a high-end shot, as his one-timers generate a ton of velocity. His skating is a bit of a knock, as he lacks a separation gear coming down the wing.</p>

<p>An Oregon native, Yan had a pretty strong first QMJHL season, and was a top scorer for Shawinigan. He also had a strong Ivan Hlinka tourney performance. It's all about upside with Yan, as he's big, with a ton of offensive ability. He looks like a first-round player when he has the puck, as he's very creative, shifty, patient, good in tight spaces and sees the ice well. Yan's hands allow him to put away chances around the net well, and he also features an above-average wrist shot. His physical game, skating and off-puck reads could use some work.</p>

<p>Garland's development ticked up quite a few notches this season after he went undrafted last year, as he led the QMJHL in scoring and was named the league's MVP. He's an electric offensive talent who makes some really unique plays with the puck; he's perhaps the class's best dangler. Overall, he understands all the different ways he can create offense, and processes that information quickly. He's not a blazing speedster, but he's shifty, with a good burst and edge control. His size is the obvious flaw, and likely why he was passed over last year.</p>

<p>Ahl didn't stand out at any one level, but was solid in the Sweden junior league, earning a lot of games with the big club in the SHL, and was a very effective two-way forward during international tournaments. He's a towering player, and has a good physical game. His first few skating strides aren't the prettiest, but he gets where he needs to go and has the speed to push defensemen back. He creates by driving the tough areas, making players miss and has set-up skills, too. His hockey IQ isn't great, as he can force plays and get behind the pace at times.</p>

<p>The Etobicoke, Ontario, native's production didn't meet expectations this season, but he scores a fair number of goals, and his two-way game makes him an intriguing prospect. Knott has great physical tools, with above-average skating abilities. He's a pretty advanced defensive player, and is a solid penalty killer. Knott has decent puck skills and IQ, but I wouldn't characterize him as an overly skilled or creative player. He's at his best when he's skating hard, going to the front of the net, and making simple plays.</p>

<p>A player of Swedish/Ukrainian descent, Timashov has never played in an IIHF game, was good but not amazing last season in Sweden, and then came overseas for 2014-15 and lit the Quebec league on fire. He's a fantastic skater with explosive acceleration and speed, and combined with his puck-handling skills, this makes him very threatening off the rush. Timashov has a lot of flash to his game, and though he can force plays at times, overall he makes a lot happen. He's another undersized guy, with the requisite issues in one-on-one battles and in the defensive zone.</p>

His hands aren't that great, but his vision helps him make plays.</p>

<p>Though he's not notable in terms of pure talent, he shows positive signs in almost every aspect of his game. He's an above-average to plus skater, and excels in tight spaces due to his agility and puck skills. A very smart two-way player, he creates a lot of chances from the side boards. He shows good effort on defense and is a decent penalty killer. His physical game is the obvious limitation, as he does not project to be all that effective as a pro in that area.</p>

His production wasn't amazing this season, but he remains a desirable prospect. He has good speed and agility, although he's not the ideal blazer as a small player. Tkachev's play off the puck also needs a lot of work. His defense isn't great, and it's his physical game that is his biggest weakness. He also needs to work on consistency of effort.</p>

The former first-round QMJHL pick is a fantastic skater with the explosive first few steps and straight-line bursts to put defensemen on their heels. Richard plays with good pace, and has the skill to make tough plays. He's a smart playmaker who can play the point on the man advantage, and has the creativity to gain the zone. There is a question of how his defense will translate to the pro level, especially without a bulkier frame.</p><p></p>

Gavrikov has a great first few steps, above-average top speed, and very impressive technique on his turns and start/stops. He's got a pro frame and plays a rugged physical game. On the defensive end, he plays a responsible game and doesn't go out of his way to connect on hits. Gavrikov shows small flashes of offensive IQ, but for the most part he's a subpar puck handler who is at his best when he's playing a conservative game.</p>

Greenway is a bulky forward who uses his body well to win battles and protect the puck, and his offensive IQ shows very good flashes. Greenway skates and handles the puck well for a big man, although he's not top-end in either area. He has the tools and work ethic to succeed, but again, he'll need some developing.

<p>Spencer was the third overall pick in his OHL draft, and is a very toolsy all-around defenseman. At his best, he can be a very effective puck mover who is dangerous on the power play due to his skill and shot. He's very physical on his checks, with a well-developed frame for a draft prospect. Spencer makes defensive stops, but his D-zone play isn't completely clean, as he'll get beat on his positional reads here and there. He has the potential to be a very significant NHL player if he puts it all together.</p>

<p>Noel has been one of the very best prospects to come out of the eastern provinces in recent years. He is a high-end skater who gets up to his top gear with the best in this class, and is very elusive in his ability to dominate puck possession. His decisions aren't great, but his creativity is impressive. I've seen flashes of good defensive play from Noel, but it's an area he'll have to continue to improve on even if it showed upward ticks in the second half. His main weakness is his physicality, as he's slightly undersized, needs a lot of bulk and plays a perimeter game.</p>

A very good skater, he has a quick first few steps and consistently shows the ability to push defensemen back on his zone entries. He's not the best in terms of physical play, but he darts around the rink with good energy. His off-puck work needs improvement, but there are enough raw tools here to make him a very intriguing prospect.</p>

<p>Juulsen was one of the top CHL defenseman scorers this season, and he rose up my board as the campaign went along. He has above-average mobility and puck-moving skills, which is why he was a mainstay for Everett all season on the power play. Juulsen plays a good physical game, which should get better as he puts on more bulk. However, he can be overly aggressive at times, and leave his ideal defensive position. Overall, his defensive-zone play is about average, and he projects more as an offensively tilted player.</p>

He's a North American type of prospect, with a very developed frame for a player his age. Trenin is tough on the puck, maintaining possession well in battles, and shows ability in the defensive zone and on the PK. He's more of a pass-first type of player, but has a solid shot when he gets his opportunities. His skating remains rough, and while I've heard some scouts say they don't mind it, I see a lot of room for improvement in that area.</p>

<p>Dunn was one of the top scoring defensemen in the OHL this season on a very inconsistent Niagara team. His skating is clearly high-end, and there are very few defensemen who are better at leading a rush. His great skating allows him to make up for defensive miscues, as I've seen him catch guys like Connor McDavid when they had a step on him. He's great on the power play given his creativity and puck skills. The drawback? His defensive play is certainly a work in progress.</p>

He doesn't stand out at either end of the rink, but he's a solid two-way player. Offensively, he displays solid-to-average stick skills, with fine mobility and straight-line speed. On defense, he makes some stops, wins battles, and was able to kill penalties at the under-18 level. Carlsson gets beat a little too much by speed, and his overall decision-making could use some tweaking.</p><p></p>

2014-15 GP: 64 | G: 17 | A: 25</strong></p>
<p>Impressive as a rookie for his hometown Blazers, Sideroff capped off his campaign with a very solid IIHF World U18 Championship, with four points in seven games. He's undersized but contributes in a lot of areas. Sideroff is a few inches shorter than the average pro, but he has an edge to his game and will fight for pucks. He also exhibits fine two-way hockey IQ. A player on the rise.</p>

<p>Rykov is a very toolsy prospect who has drawn attention in international play this season. He moves pretty easily in all directions for a player of his size, with a polished stride and above-average speed. Oddly, he doesn't have a good physical game, often opting to stick check and not engage. On the other hand, he rarely takes a penalty. He has shown an ability to play on both special teams.</p>

<p>Bear played his way onto Canada's under-18 team with an impressive summer camp, and played in all manpower situations for Seattle this season. He's a well-rounded prospect but doesn't have standout attributes. I've seen him get burned at times to the outside, but overall he's able to stay with his checks and is solid on defense. Offensively, he's not a great skill player, but he can make some plays and has good offensive IQ.</p>

<p>Nattinen played pro hockey all season, bouncing between the top Finnish division and the second-tier league while also being very impressive in international play. He's a big, skilled, two-way center and a very smart playmaker. His frame is developed for a player his age, and while he's not a real mean physical player, he can be strong on the puck. His main liability is his skating, which is notably below-average at this point.</p>

<p>Here's another guy who trended up in a significant way this season. He's one of the quickest players in this draft class, with an elite top gear and an ability to push defensemen off their gaps. He's solid defensively, including on the penalty kill. Some believe he plays a little too much of a North-South game, but still makes offensive plays. Senyshyn plays with energy, but his physical game is subpar as of now.</p>

2014-15 GP: 72 | G: 15 | A: 39</strong></p>
<p>Gawdin is a solid two-way center and the No. 5 overall pick in his WHL bantam draft. He's a solid-to-above-average skater, with good technique and a quick first step. He's not overly flashy, but on occasion he shows a dynamic offensive element. Gawdin finishes his checks with authority, gets back on defense, and gets in the opponent's lanes consistently. He was used in most situations for Swift Current, including being a go-to faceoff guy.</p>

<p>With Carlsson, it's more about the scouting projection as opposed to the statistical production, because there wasn't much of the latter. To put it simply: He's great defensively. He is always coming over the boards for any tough defensive zone draw, and to start most penalty kills. He's very smart in his own end, closing on his checks well, getting in lanes and disrupting offensive setups. His puck skills are not the greatest, but he can jump up into the play here and there.</p><p></p>

2014-15 GP: 69 | G: 28 | A: 35</strong></p>
<p>A big part of a pretty good Victoria team, Soy was leaned on to center the top line and play both special teams. He's not a fantastic skater, probably sitting around average but flashing a tick beyond there. Defensively, he's pretty effective in terms of his off-puck reads. He's a bit of a beanpole and does not project to have much of a physical game in the NHL.</p>

<p>Capobianco was a rare bright spot in a dismal season for Sudbury and was one of the team's top scorers. Even on a brutal team, Capobianco has been able to generate offense from the back end with a very impressive combination of skating and skill. He has some two-way ability and a little bite, but his defensive reads and overall decision-making could use some work. He has a lot of upside and could be a great value pick in the mid rounds.</p>

2014-15 GP: 72 | G: 5 | A: 27</strong></p>
<p>The former No. 3 overall WHL pick is a very gifted defenseman with intriguing tools, despite a lack of production. Guhle is as mobile as some of the best defensemen available in this class. He's not a dynamic offensive player in the WHL, but shows flashes of his skill and puck-moving abilities. He is decent defensively, showing fine reads, but he's not that tough on his checks. Filling out his frame may help.</p>

<p>Brodecki had a great season for an under-20 player in Sweden's top league, and he ticked up significantly in his third draft-eligible season. His hockey sense is a standout trait at both ends of the rink. Brodecki sees the options developing well as a playmaker, has good offensive creativity and the awareness to be an effective penalty killer. Brodecki has shown ability against pros to make things happen at both ends, but lacks the high-end "wow" factor and upside of others.</p>

<p>After being selected in the ninth round in the OHL draft, he's seen his stock rise quite a bit this season. He's a two-way defenseman but his value is tiled more toward offense. He rarely forces plays, and makes good outlets under pressure. He's slightly undersized, but Dermott does battle hard for pucks and shows fine defensive IQ. Overall, his defensive-zone play projects to be about average as a pro, although he's been solid in that area as an OHLer.</p>

<p>Mangiapane went undrafted after an impressive rookie OHL season, but he really turned his game up in his second draft-eligible campaign. His skating is excellent in all regards. His skill level isn't as high-end, but he makes a lot of plays. His defense isn't superb, but he's shown he can be an asset on the penalty kill. His physical game is the big question mark -- given his size -- and he may have issues against NHL defensemen.</p>

<p>A bottom of the lineup player in Finland's top league this season, Tammela stood out at the under-18 level. He's dangerous off the rush with his speed and has also shown to be a short-handed threat. His size isn't ideal, but he battles hard. Tammela will be a good upside pick in the middle-to-late rounds, as he has the ability to break out if he's developed well.</p>

<p>Lauzon had a very solid second QMJHL season, being used in all situations for the Huskies. A really effective skater with impressive rushing speed, he has the ability to stick with quick forwards. He can be a little risky at times with the puck, but tends to make plays. Defensively, Lauzon plays the body and is a good poke checker.</p>

<p>A Texas-born player who comes out of a Massachusetts high school, one NHL scout calls him a "potential home run." Cotton is a player who shows above-average raw possession abilities between his puck skills and offensive creativity. He has good size, but scouts point out he's not particularly tough in battles. His skating isn't bad, but it's not a plus attribute, either. Like any high school prospect, most evaluators aren't sure what to make of Cotton's hockey IQ, given that there's concern about whether he makes great plays because he's a real prospect, or because he's a big kid playing high school hockey. He is committed to Boston College in 2016-17.</p>

<p>Schemitsch was very impressive in his second full OHL season, playing in all manpower situations. Despite a filled-out frame, he's not overly physical. On the other hand, he's got a great wingspan and consistently lands his stick checks. Offensively, he's a little above-average. His upside as a two-way defenseman is intriguing, and he has the potential to be a sleeper candidate if his development continues at its current trajectory.</p><p></p>
