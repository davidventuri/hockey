<p>Overall, I'd say the 2016 NHL draft class is average. The very top of the class has three top-tier prospects -- which is better than average -- with the rest of the first round being standard. The depth in lower rounds is below-average. Longtime readers know I can get a little eccentric with the lower portion of my draft boards, but this was the hardest tail end for me to sort out in a few years. There's a drop off in talent after prospects No. 2 and No. 3, before the gradual decline in marginal prospect value throughout the rest of the class.</p>

<p>The information used to develop these rankings and profiles are done through a variety of methods. I've seen a large chunk of these players live in the past 12 months. I supplement that with discussions with scouts, executives and other hockey people for evaluation and background information, and also perform statistical research and watch video of the players. While discussions with others take place, the rankings are completely my own, and are done to reflect my opinion of who I believe the top prospects in the draft class are, and may differ from the industry.</p>
<p>Here are the top 100 skaters eligible for this year's draft, along with expanded rankings explanations for the top 10.</p>
<p><offer></offer></p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/liiga.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>1. Patrik Laine, LW, Tampere (Liiga)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 4/19/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-4 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 206<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 46 | <strong>G:</strong> 17 | <strong>A:</strong> 16</p>
<p>Laine is everything you want in a high-skill power forward. First, he's built like a truck at 6-foot-4, 206 pounds, with broad shoulders and great core strength. It's a joy to watch film of Laine shrugging off checks left and right, and easily winning loose puck battles. He's equally adept at being a playmaker as he is being a goal scorer. Laine's offensive IQ is high-end, bordering on elite. He's a very creative puck handler who anticipates pressure well, and knows how to create space for himself. He moves the puck quickly with few errors.</p>
<p>Off the puck, he finds the open seams well, and can launch a scoring chance from almost anywhere on the ice, having probably the best shot in this class. Laine's skating is his one notable flaw, although he's gotten a little quicker from last season. He's average in that area, and I don't think he's going to jet past NHL defensemen. Overall, he's a special forward, someone who could be an elite scoring power winger in the NHL for the next decade.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking explanation:</strong> We're gonna need more than a paragraph on this one. <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nhl/insider/story/_/id/15511937/why-patrik-laine-top-prospect-2016-nhl-draft">Click here</a> to read my case for Laine over Auston Matthews.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/swiss.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>2. Auston Matthews, C, Zug (NLA)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 9/17/97 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-2 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 210<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 36 | <strong>G:</strong> 24 | <strong>A:</strong> 22</p>
<p>Teams dream about getting a legit No. 1 center like Matthews when picking at the top of the draft. A 6-foot-2, 210-pound pivot with a skill level that is off the charts, he's also got professional experience to boot, and he's been making Swiss cheese out of his opponents in the NLA. Matthews is a magician with the puck; not one of those pretend magicians you'll find in Las Vegas, but like the ones you read about in fiction novels. He is so coordinated and creative that it's nearly impossible to strip him of the puck. Combining that with an incredible touch that can have him effortlessly saucer pass across the rink onto the blade, or place it on a shot wherever he wants to, and he's a nightmare for teams to defend. He's a very good skater, and while he's not among the very top tier of the class in terms of speed, he can explode down the ice with anyone.</p>
<p>Matthews isn't perfect. His real weakness is when the offense isn't flowing through him. He's not a really physical player who will grind for pucks along the wall, nor is he some sort of defensive stalwart. Matthews still uses his big frame to win pucks and competes well on the ice in every zone, but the team drafting him must be realistic about what he's going to be in terms of the gritty areas of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking explanation:</strong> Jesse Puljujarvi is a fantastic prospect, one of the best under-18 players to ever don the Finland jersey. His 16- and 17-year-old performances at the IIHF World Junior Championship (WJC) are among the all-time greats. He's big, skilled, fast and advanced in his play. He's just not at the same level as Matthews and Laine. I can't think of one attribute he's substantially better at than Matthews, except for possibly his physical play; he's quicker than Laine and a little better defensively. They have him beat in every other area, either marginally or notably.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/liiga.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>3. Jesse Puljujarvi, RW, Karpat (Liiga)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 5/7/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-4 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 203<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 50 | <strong>G:</strong> 13 | <strong>A:</strong> 15</p>
<p>Puljujarvi is one of the most exciting prospects Finland has produced. He's a big, explosive winger, who was the second-highest scoring 17-year-old ever at the WJC, tied with <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/543/eric-lindros">Eric Lindros</a> and a point behind <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/405/jaromir-jagr">Jaromir Jagr</a>. He's an unbelievable skater for a 6-foot-4 player, having a great top gear and a really fluid stride. He's not that physically aggressive, but he closes on guys so well that he pressures and wins battles effectively. Puljujarvi shows a high-skill level, a plus shot and high-end hockey IQ. He is constantly around the puck and setting up his teammates.</p>
<p>He's not quite defensively sound yet, but he shows effort in that area, and with proper development, we could see that area of his game grow. To get an idea of what a competitor he is, a few hours before the gold medal game at the IIHF under-18 world championship, <a href="http://www.iltasanomat.fi/mmkiekko/art-2000001165589.html">Puljujarvi was sick in bed</a>. He then went out and carried his team to a championship, scoring a hat trick. (thanks to Twitter user Tuomo Vartianen for pointing this out). At his ultimate upside, he could be one of the more dynamic scorers in the NHL.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking explanation:</strong> This point has a drop off from Puljujarvi to the next group of forwards in Clayton Keller, Alexander Nylander and Matthew Tkachuk. None of these alternatives has the excellent resume or the dynamic all-around tool kit of Puljujarvi. Keller's skill is about the same, and he is a better playmaker, but Puljujarvi is a monster standing next to him, and is a better goal scorer, too. Nylander can't match his physical dominance or shot, and Tkachuk doesn't skate as well. They all may be better at one or two things than Puljujarvi, but then it's either a push or a slant to Puljujarvi in every other attribute.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ushl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>4. Clayton Keller, C, USA U18 (USHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 6/29/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 5-10 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 168<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 55 | <strong>G:</strong> 33 | <strong>A:</strong> 60</p>
<p>One of the best players ever to participate at the USA Hockey National Team Development Program (USNTDP), Keller put up monstrous numbers between his USHL, collegiate and international performances. He's a complete offensive player who seems to generate chances and display distinct puck-moving abilities whenever he takes a shift. Keller has an explosive first step and an above-average top gear. He's not an incredible skater for a smaller guy, but he still skates very well. Keller handles the puck at a top level, too, but his clear best trait is his hockey sense. He just makes so many good, high-level decisions with and without the puck that allow his team to maintain possession and get shooting lanes. Keller never seems rattled with the puck, and makes the right plays seem easy.</p>
<p>While not a defensive stalwart, Keller has shown decent defensive prowess this season. His size and physical game limitations are obvious issues, but there is a lot to like in his game other than that.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking explanation:</strong> One could argue the stats favor Pierre-Luc Dubois over Keller, as the former has been a scoring and shots machine in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), even though Keller was among the best scorers in USNTDP history. However, Keller shows a different level of skill. His vision is much better, he's a better skater and puck handler, and while Dubois is bigger and a better defensive player, Keller was no slouch defensively. He was often the first player coach <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/4636/danton-cole">Danton Cole</a> sent over the boards in a critical defensive situation. Compared to Tkachuk, Keller is nearly a full year younger than him, so I almost take a glance at Tkachuk during his time in the NTDP last season versus Keller now, and it's a no-brainer in Keller's favor. Obviously, one has to consider what Tkachuk has done since then, but he didn't have an overwhelmingly great season, nor do his tools grade at such a higher level than Keller's, other than his physical game. Nylander and Keller have similar skill sets, but Keller is a competent center and better defensively.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/qmjhl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>5. Pierre-Luc Dubois, C, Cape Breton (QMJHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 6/24/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-2 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 201<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 62 | <strong>G:</strong> 42 | <strong>A:</strong> 57</p>
<p>Dubois was one of the best players in the QMJHL this season and nearly made Canada's WJC team. I've never watched Dubois play and come away thinking he's the best skater or the best puck handler in a given match, but he always makes a positive contribution. He's incredibly well-rounded, though. Dubois can play both the wing and center effectively, but is more comfortable on the wing. He's a skilled scorer with very good two-way hockey IQ who can flash high-end vision.</p>
<p>He's a very physically developed player, who is strong, competitive on the ice, drives to the dirty areas, and is committed to his fitness off the ice. Whenever Dubois gets into a 1-on-1 battle, he tends to come out with the puck. He's not the fastest skater but he doesn't slug around the ice, either. He projects as an NHL forward who can be slotted into a variety of roles, and has a low-risk factor on his projection.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking explanation:</strong> I had Tkachuk at the No. 5 spot for a decent chunk of the season, until Dubois switched to playing center full time for Cape Breton and doing it well. A decent component of this ranking is projecting that Dubois will end up an NHL center, which is something that not every NHL scout I've talked to believes in. Like in the Keller case, Tkachuk is notably older than Dubois, and has more experience, but I don't see as much of a skill gap. In fact, one could argue Tkachuk has a slightly higher skill level and better vision. Skating is pretty much a push as well. However, Dubois is a much more effective defensive player and a little better in his physical play. Nylander wasn't as dominant this season in the OHL as Dubois was in the QMJHL, however I see the argument his pure upside is higher. I don't see the offensive ceiling between the two being dramatically different, but Dubois has the much better two-way game.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>6. Matthew Tkachuk, LW, London (OHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 12/11/97 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-2 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 200<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 57 | <strong>G:</strong> 30 | <strong>A:</strong> 77</p>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/944/keith-tkachuk">Keith Tkachuk</a>'s son has been a standout for years at multiple levels. He was great last season in the USHL and with the USNTDP, was a top player at the world under-18 championship, and a top player this season in the OHL. He is a multi-dimensional scoring winger. You talk to any scout about Tkachuk, they come back raving about his hockey IQ. He has great vision and offensive creativity, and makes quick, precise decisions with the puck. He can dangle defensemen, and create offense out of nothing, but Tkachuk is also a relentless worker. He wins more than his fair share of battles, and is his father's son on some days, being a pain in the rear for many defenders and goalies.</p>
<p>His speed isn't at the same level as his hands and vision. He's not slow, but he's certainly not a top-end speedster, either. Tkachuk can also get caught cheating a little defensively, an area of his game that he'll need to tighten up.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking explanation:</strong> I flip-flopped on Tkachuk vs. Nylander probably every week in the lead up to this list, and it wasn't until Tkachuk's extremely strong showing in the OHL postseason tilted the needle a bit. I've talked to scouts who strongly believe in one or the other, but for me this is a pure coin flip. They are both very skilled and intelligent players who have produced in the OHL and internationally. Nylander is a little better with the puck, is a better skater, and also has played one fewer season than Tkachuk. However, Tkachuk is a little smarter, much tougher in puck battles and has been a more consistent force in terms of controlling puck possession during the past two years. His ability to consistently elevate his game at any level makes me lean to Tkachuk.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>7. Alexander Nylander, RW, Mississauga (OHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 3/2/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-1 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 180<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 57 | <strong>G:</strong> 28 | <strong>A:</strong> 47</p>
<p>Brother of Leafs prospect <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3114736/william-nylander">William Nylander</a> and son of former NHLer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/686/michael-nylander">Michael Nylander</a>, Alexander was one of the top scorers in the OHL this season, and was one of the top under-18 scorers ever at the WJC. His skill level and his offensive hockey sense are elite. Nylander is able to think the game so quickly, and dominate possession whenever he gets near the puck. He sees options developing even without directly looking down the lanes, and is able to create space for himself. He's got guts with the puck, sometimes putting the puck in risky spots, but overall he makes plays few other forwards do.</p>
<p>Nylander's speed is not elite, but it's certainly above-average and flashes a grade above on top of his being very agile on his edges. He also features a quality wrist shot as well. Nylander's defense could still use work. He's too prone to losing battles and can misplay his position, but he did show significant progression in that area as the season went on, and steadily earned penalty killing time in the second half. He shows strong work ethic, and you can envision him cleaning up that area with proper development.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking explanation:</strong> The merits of Nylander or really any of these top forwards over a top defenseman like Olli Juolevi or Jakob Chychrun comes down to two factors: The degree of talent and the value of the position. Forwards are considerably more valuable (http://es.pn/1DCnuRD) than defensemen in today's NHL, so for a defenseman to overtake a forward on my board, he needs to be notably better in terms of pure talent. When comparing the set of forwards versus the set of defensemen in this year's class, we have several players who have excelled in league play and internationally but haven't dominated. We have players with very good skill sets, but either have a crucial flaw or are not elite across the board. Given these circumstances, always take the forward.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>8. Olli Juolevi, D, London (OHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 5/5/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-2 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 182<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 57 | <strong>G:</strong> 9 | <strong>A:</strong> 33</p>
<p>One of the best defensemen in the OHL this season, Juolevi also recorded the highest point totals ever by an under-18 defenseman at the WJC. Juolevi is a fantastic skater. He exerts very little effort to get up to a dangerous top gear and moves well in all directions. His puck movement is high-end, as he shows calmness, skill and elite hockey sense when he has the puck on his stick. He's able to QB a power play with the best of them, on top of creating dangerous chances in transition. He's also not afraid to take risks, but he's very calculating when he does, and rarely does he hurt his team.</p>
<p>Juolevi's smarts translate to defense. He is always getting his stick on pucks and is an overall reliable defensive player in his positional play. He could stand to bulk up quite a bit, as he has a bit of a beanpole frame (6-foot-2, 182 pounds). However, Juolevi still works hard on the ice to win battles and get to pucks even if his frame isn't ideal for those situations yet.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking explanation:</strong> This ranking explanation has two parts. First, the reason for ranking him over Tyson Jost is because there is a notable difference in talent level between the two. Juolevi is a top-of-the-line skater, with elite hockey IQ, and while Jost does a lot of things very well he doesn't have any particular elite attributes.</p>
<p>The second is Juolevi versus the other defensemen available. There is no clear top defenseman in this year's class, but here is why I tilt toward Juolevi. Chychrun and Mikhail Sergachyov have been more productive in the OHL this season, but Juolevi has a better toolkit. He's as good a skater and puck handler as both of them, but the differentiator is hockey sense. While Chychrun and Sergachyov are bigger, better physically and have better shots, Juolevi is much smarter than both, and can control the flow of a game at both ends. Dante Fabbro's hockey IQ is at that level, maybe even higher, but Juolevi is a much better skater. I could see reasonable quibbles over this placement, especially since Juolevi did not dominate the OHL, but he had one of the best WJCs I've ever seen by a 17-year-old defenseman. It's a gut call on my part; your gut may differ.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/bc_hl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>9. Tyson Jost, C, Penticton (BCHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 3/14/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 5-11 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 191<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 48 | <strong>G:</strong> 42 | <strong>A:</strong> 62</p>
<p>Jost was simply fantastic this season, putting up huge numbers for a 17-year-old in the BCHL, even when you adjust for its lesser league quality. He is a dynamic, athletic center with decent off-the-puck skills as well. Jost is one of the better skaters in his draft class, with an easy, explosive stride whose first few steps will be able to evade NHL checkers. He's a highly-skilled puck handler who can execute high-difficulty plays in tight spaces, as well as make above-average passes.</p>
<p>Jost's defensive play has shown significant improvement during this season. I didn't love his defensive positioning last year, but by the world under-18 championship in the spring, he was arguably Canada's best defensive forward. Bigger players can muscle him off pucks too easily at times. However, Jost does work his tail off, often being one of the hardest working players on the ice on top of being one of the most skilled. He has committed to the University of North Dakota for next season.</p><p></p>

<p><strong>10. Dante Fabbro, D, Penticton (BCHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 6/20/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-0 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 189<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 45 | <strong>G:</strong> 14 | <strong>A:</strong> 53</p>
<p>An outstanding two-way defenseman who was the best defenseman in the BCHL this season, Fabbro also had strong showings in international play. His hockey IQ is among the best in this draft class. The way Fabbro moves the puck dictates the tempo of the shift. His passes are accurate but also very crisp, as he puts his full weight into a lot of his breakout passes. He's so calm and aware on his outlets, and is a decent skater, which lets him rush the puck up as well. Fabbro can QB a power play, and has some creativity in his game.</p>
<p>He's got a decent frame, will engage his checks physically and is a quality positional player. There's an occasional mistake on that end, but for the most part he's a pretty sound player. He is committed to play next season at Boston University.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking explanation:</strong> I came into the season with Chychrun being rated a few spots higher than Fabbro, and as we went from August to May, I was continually impressed by Fabbro while waiting for Chychrun to have those "wow" games. Mind you, Chychrun was still great all season, and struggled through some injuries, but he never showed the offensive upside Fabbro did. For me, Fabbro projects to be a moderately better puck mover in the NHL, while Chychrun projects to be slightly better defensively. That matters -- given that they are defensemen -- but still makes me tilt toward Fabbro, given the IQ/offense gap he's shown. What's more, they played together for two weeks -- often on the same pairing -- in the final weeks of the season, with Fabbro elevating his play over Chychrun.</p><p></p>

<p>Son of former No. 47 overall pick (1984) <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/4708/jeff-chychrun">Jeff Chychrun</a>, Jakob has been on the prospect radar for years, as one of the top players in the 1998 age group for a while; that includes his being the top pick in his OHL draft year. Chychrun was one of the better defenders in the OHL this season. He's a high-end skater, with excellent agility. Chychrun has above-average skill, and while he isn't a dangler, he can evade pressure well and move the puck very effectively on the man advantage. Chychrun thinks the game pretty well defensively. He's an advanced positional player, and given his very strong frame and great work ethic, he is a very reliable penalty killer. Offensively, he shows the ability to move the puck well and make some skill plays, but he can make some bad decisions and doesn't show high-end creativity.</p><p></p>

<p>A native of Raleigh, North Carolina, Brown has been a much-discussed prospect in the scouting ranks for years, and for a variety of reasons. He is often defined as having "all the tools." He's a 6-foot-6 center, with high-end skill who can dominate a game whenever he gets near the puck. He's a very smart playmaker with great patience, vision and instincts. Though not a blazer, he skates extremely well for a player his size. If there weren't some consistent negatives hanging on him, he'd have all the capabilities to be in the top five of this class. One of the negatives is that he can be a non-factor off the puck. Historically, he's had a tendency to shy away from physical play, and his defensive effort isn't good, although the latter area showed significant improvement in the second half of this season. His work ethic on and off the ice have been criticized, but Brown seemed to take those critiques to heart, and really impressed in the past few months. If he maintains that trend, he could be a game-breaking center.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 28 | <strong>G:</strong> 12 | <strong>A:</strong> 14</p>
<p>The well-rounded Rubtsov was the top player on the inaugural Russia under-18 team this season, and showed well in international play. Offensively, he has the traits one would expect of a top Russian prospect. He's an above-average skater, with a good first step and an easy stride. His skills aren't elite, but he shows good hands and is able to create space for himself. His hockey IQ is very impressive, as he displays great patience with the puck, sees his options well and always finds himself involved with the play. Rubtsov is a fierce competitor in puck battles and, despite having a lean frame, is able to win a fair amount of them. He's also a quality defensive center, who has been leaned on all season in critical defensive situations, and is often a threat to score shorthanded. Though he and the rest of his teammates were disqualified from the under-18 world championships, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/insider/story/_/id/15160778/how-russian-doping-scandal-impacts-2016-draft-nhl">it's hard to see his draft stock slipping too much</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>Bellows, son of former No. 2 overall pick (1982) <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/4260/brian-bellows">Brian Bellows</a>, has been one of the top players in the USHL for the past two seasons. He's followed a unique path. After skating for Sioux Falls of the USHL in 2014-15, he joined the USA Hockey National Team Development Program (USNTDP) for his second season of eligibility, and was the under-18 team's second-best player this season; he currently ranks among the best goal scorers ever in the program. Stylistically, Bellows is a scoring power winger. He's got a sturdy, developed frame, plays with an edge and brings a lot of offensive tools to the table. He shows above-average puck skills and offensive hockey sense, and has a high-end shot. In fact, he was a shots machine this season, with one of the highest shots-per-game rates in the USHL. However, Bellows' skating has been a consistent issue in his game. He just doesn't have any sort of explosiveness in his stride. His defensive play isn't too great either, which may be a product of his skating as opposed to any work ethic issues. He has committed to Boston University for next season.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>15. Alex DeBrincat, RW, Erie (OHL)</strong><br>

<strong>GP:</strong> 60 | <strong>G:</strong> 51 | <strong>A:</strong> 50</p>
<p>The diminutive DeBrincat has been one of the top scorers in the CHL during the past two seasons. Following 2014-15, there were lingering criticisms that summed up to "that's all great, but he played on a line with <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3895074/connor-mcdavid">Connor McDavid</a>." This past season, DeBrincat put a lot of those concerns to rest with a dominant campaign. He's a highly-skilled winger who shows above-average to high-end speed, puck skills, vision and finishing skill. DeBrincat is constantly buzzing around the ice making all sorts of offensive plays. His elite hockey sense allows him to be in the right place and control the puck with confidence. He was one of the very best forwards in the CHL in terms of generating scoring chances. In terms of the negatives, DeBrincat is very small, coming in at 5-foot-7, but has a real tenacity to his game. He drives the net, battles for pucks and wins some scrums versus much bigger players. His defense isn't great and his size will obviously hold him back there, but there is still a lot to like.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 34 | <strong>G:</strong> 19 | <strong>A:</strong> 13</p>
<p>Kunin was Wisconsin's best player this season as a freshman, and generated insane shot totals for a player in his first season, nearly hitting the 4.0 mark per game. He's such an easy player to admire, because he's such a well-rounded player. Kunin's speed is above-average, and on occasion I've seen him touch a real separation gear as well. He plays with skill and intensity, showing the ability to go around and through defenders. His hockey IQ is also a positive attribute, although he can sometimes force some bad decisions. Kunin shows impressive vision, on top of being aware defensively and a capable penalty killer. Finally, Kunin features a plus shot, being a feared goal scorer at the NCAA, USHL and international levels. There really isn't a ton to nitpick in the Missouri native's game, other than he probably won't be an NHL game breaker, but I definitely can see him making a long career of some form in the league.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 67 | <strong>G:</strong> 17 | <strong>A:</strong> 40</p>
<p>Sergachyov had a very strong rookie season in the OHL, displaying two-way abilities and putting up big counting numbers from the blue line. He was the youngest player ever to win the OHL Defenseman of the Year award. Sergachyov is a fantastic skater for a big man, showing a technically sound stride and an above-average first step. He moves the puck well, is a creative power-play quarterback showing good patience and vision, and has a rocket for a shot. Sergachyov wins battles, shuts down lanes due to his speed, frame and toughness, and has an edge to his game as well. His defensive positioning can use some tweaking, but he shows a decent amount of awareness in that area, even if I wouldn't qualify his hockey IQ as high-end. He's a player with a lot of upside.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/whl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<p>A former elite prospect for many years, Benson's season was upended from several injuries to his lower body and back. Even when he was playing, he was at 50 percent at the best of times. Benson has great instincts, constantly finding seams to get the puck to his teammates or on net. "He never wows you," said one scout, "but he's always around the puck, making a good play." Benson is a quality defensive forward with great work ethic in battles and solid overall positional play. He doesn't shy away from throwing a hit, and is strong on the puck. His skating isn't superb, but I thought it was decent prior to this season, with the injuries possibly accentuating the issues. He has the tools to be a top-six forward in the NHL, but there are big risk factors attached to making him a first-round pick as well. I'm banking on a recovery and a return to top form next season, but he's clearly one of this class' biggest wild cards.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/whl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<p>Bean was one of the top defenders in the WHL this season, which is pretty incredible given that he was never drafted into the WHL and has improved by leaps and bounds. "NHL hockey sense, he's got it," one NHL GM said. Bean processes the game so well, and when he gets the puck he moves it quickly and into the right spots. He never gets pressured into bad calls by fore-checkers, evading checks and maintaining possession very well. He's certainly an offensively tilted player, with above-average hands, and high-end vision on top of having a quality shot. Bean has improved his skating a lot from 12 months ago, but his first step or so is still a little slushy. Despite average size and skating, he's still a decent defensive player due to his hockey sense, and could potentially play on a second PK unit at his peak in the NHL; however, he's not a real physical defender.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 57 | <strong>G:</strong> 21 | <strong>A:</strong> 40</p>
<p>The Mississauga native had a very good season for the Steelheads. He is a highly-skilled and competitive center who brings a lot of elements to the table. He's an elite skater, which is a remarkable trait for a 6-foot-2 player. He plays with such a tenacious energy to his game, and his first few steps are as good as anyone in the draft. McLeod has above-average skill possession, good hand-eye coordination, a solid level of creativity and can move the puck well to his teammates. He brings a physical component to his game, and while not a defensive stalwart, he is quite solid defensively for a player his age, projecting as a two-way center as a pro. The main concern for McLeod is how high his offensive upside is, and if his instincts, vision and overall IQ are high-end enough to create enough offense without his big speed advantage once he reaches the NHL.</p><p></p>

<p>Abramov landed in North America with a bang, as one of the top-scoring 17-year-olds in the CHL and the highest scorer on the Olympiques by 20 points. He's a well-rounded offensive player with a lot of flair to his game. Abramov is a skilled, confident puck handler who can make dynamic stick plays with consistency. He shows a lot of creativity in how he creates space and tries to generate scoring chances, and he displays above-average to high-end vision, as well. Abramov is a slippery and quick skater who can be very difficult to check in open ice, given his speed and how well he spins off pressure. His size is a hindrance, as he comes in at about 5-foot-9, but he works hard to try to get pucks. He could improve his defense, as he can take too many risks trying to create offense.</p><p></p>

<p>Clague has been a big name in the prospect world for a number of years. Although he didn't have as stellar a season as expected, he was quite effective as a two-way defenseman and showed well in his time playing for the Canadian under-17 team. He is one of the best pure skaters in this draft class. His ability to escape pressure is elite, he's got a great first step, and he can jump up into the attack as well as anybody. Although I don't love his puck skills, Clague shows high-end vision with the puck and projects as a useful power-play option. Defensively, he's a feisty player despite being undersized. His defensive positioning overall is quite solid, as he uses his skating and stick to make stops.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/qmjhl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 46 | <strong>G:</strong> 17 | <strong>A:</strong> 16</p>
<p>One of the most dangerous draft-eligible offensive defensemen the QMJHL has seen in decades, Girard was great the past two seasons. He's an elite skater and one of the most elusive small-space skaters I've seen in a few years. Although he isn't going to dangle on end-to-end rushes every game, he has the ability to make high-level offensive plays. I don't love his shot, but he's very good at creating for his teammates and opening up the ice. Girard's main knock is his size, as he comes in at a sturdy 5-foot-9. He won't win a ton of battles, but he's competitive, doesn't tend to cross the line with penalties and can win a least a handful of puck battles.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 54 | <strong>G:</strong> 41 | <strong>A:</strong> 16</p>
<p>Gauthier was one of the top goal scorers in the CHL this season, and he was the only draft-eligible player to make Team Canada's team at the WJC. Gauthier is an exciting and dynamic scorer who brings a lot of plus physical attributes to the table. He is a 6-foot-4 forward who is a good skater, and I'd classify him as a high-end one for a big man. Gauthier is a highly skilled puck handler who can dangle and create highlight-reel plays. Gauthier uses his size, competes for space and pucks well, and gets to the dirty areas. His defensive game could use some work, though, as he can be a little loose on his positioning.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 46 | <strong>G:</strong> 4 | <strong>A:</strong> 8</p>
<p>Although Asplund didn't translate his strong international play to great success in the SHL this season, he's still a pretty desirable prospect. There are split opinions on him within the industry, with some scouts seeing an NHL tweener and others seeing a player with a very good chance to become a top-six center. Asplund's best trait is his hockey sense. He's a creative, aware, two-way forward who creates with his hands and vision, on top of being positionally sound. Asplund is also an above-average skater with great agility on his edges and a good first step. His 5-foot-11 frame works against him, and his strength needs to go a long way before he's NHL-ready, but he shows the capability to be a solid defensive center, despite his size.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 37 | <strong>G:</strong> 3 | <strong>A:</strong> 22</p>
<p>McAvoy was one of the better freshmen in the country this season, as he served as a key puck-moving defenseman for his team and played a lesser role for the Americans at the WJC. He put up some huge point totals for a freshman, but a fair amount of that was buoyed by secondary assists. McAvoy is an offensive defenseman at heart, and he excels when he has the puck on his stick. He skates very well and shows a lot of ability to evade pressure and lead a rush. He's a pretty effective power-play quarterback, with above-average or better hands and vision. Defensively, he'll have good and bad days. He's not spectacular at checking good players or playing the body with force, and he is prone to brain cramps in his positioning and decision-making. He won't be leaned on as the first guy over the boards to kill a penalty, but it's very possible he could skate top-four minutes at his peak.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 68 | <strong>G:</strong> 30 | <strong>A:</strong> 22</p>
<p>Now we come to one of the most perplexing prospects of this draft class. In the summer, he was a no-doubt first-rounder and maybe even a top-10 pick, but he fell off that level quickly. One big issue for scouts has been Sokolov's skating and weight. His weight has been an issue all season, with him being measured over 220 pounds at times, but he managed to get it down to 205 toward the end of the season. In terms of positives, Sokolov is a highly skilled forward with an elite shot who can dominate based on his puck skills, hockey IQ and power game. He's a competitive player who notably improved his defensive play as the season went on. Despite all the doom and gloom, he scored 30 goals on a very bad Sudbury team while playing with a dislocated shoulder, and many hockey folks from Russia still believe in his upside. However, it would be an understatement to say there's risk in picking him. I know some NHL scouts who would highly, highly disagree with my placement of him at No. 27, but I see a big, highly skilled scorer who has worked to improve himself and has huge upside.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 49 | <strong>G:</strong> 7 | <strong>A:</strong> 9</p>
<p>Grundstrom has been on the NHL radar for a few years, particularly after several impressive showings last season created buzz around his name. Grudstrom's skill level has stood out to me, and he showed the ability to make high-end skill plays, but he really excels in playing a two-way forward-type of role. He has decent strength for a player his age, kills penalties well and has a little edge to his game. Grundstrom also shows slightly above-average speed, on top of pretty good puck skills. He'll occasionally make a highlight-reel type of play, but his hands and vision more consistently show as merely above-average. Grundstrom has been solid as a regular in the top Sweden league the past two years.</p><p></p>

<p>After being a second overall pick in his bantam class, Steel underwhelmed at times this season but was pretty impressive overall. He's got above-average to top-end skating, hands and hockey IQ. He can play the game with a quick tempo and shows the ability to make defenders miss with his feet and hands, while also showing the vision to create for others. Steel is not one-dimensional, and he has shown decent defensive prowess by being an effective penalty killer for his junior team and for Team Canada at the Ivan Hlinka tournament. One downgrade for Steel was a notable inconsistency in terms of his offensive play.</p><p></p>

<p>This season with London, Jones put up counting stats that were just OK, but don't be fooled by his lack of gaudy point totals. He is a legitimate top offensive talent. London was a loaded offensive team this season, and Matthew Tkachuk held down the top left wing spot, which relegated Jones to the second even-strength and power-play units. Jones is an above-average skater with a technically sound stride and very powerful first step. He is a coordinated puck handler with a fair amount of creativity and the ability to make defenders miss in open ice. Jones creates space on the ice very well with these attributes and is a tenacious worker with a strong frame and big shot. Jones has worked on his defensive play this season. His biggest remaining issues are discipline and decisions. He can cough the puck up at times, and he takes a lot of bad penalties, which shows that he can be pushed over the edge.</p><p></p>

<p>The Harvard commit was a player who consistently impressed me all season, and he was a top player for the USNTDP. He has big-time offensive upside and some of the best offensive tools among the draft-eligible defensemen. Fox can control the play very well in all three zones, shows great patience, creativity and vision, and creates space well with his puck skills. Although he isn't an elite skater, he has above-average speed and agility and is able to make plays that require evasion. Fox has shown some improvement defensively, but that remains a big issue in his game. A small defender is never going to dominate in that area, and he has been a little inconsistent in terms of positioning on that end. He is a high-risk player at times, trying to do too much, and he can pass the puck to the other team more than you'd like.</p><p></p>

<p><strong>32. Brett Howden, C, Moose Jaw (WHL)</strong><br>

<strong>GP:</strong> 68 | <strong>G:</strong> 24 | <strong>A:</strong> 40</p>
<p>A top name in prospect circles for a number of years, Brett is nearly a carbon copy of his older brother, Quinton, a first-round pick of the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/fla/florida-panthers">Florida Panthers</a> (2010) who played in 58 games for the club in 2015-16. Howden skates very well and displays an easy stride and great first step. He is a competitive, two-way forward who hustles for pucks every shift. With his size, character and hockey IQ, Howden is a very good defensive forward who has been leaned on by Moose Jaw to play critical defensive minutes. He's not a lights-out scorer, but he has some scoring tools. He'll show solid vision and shooting skills, though his hands and creativity aren't the best. He likely won't be a primary puck carrier on the power play as a pro, as he'll get more of his offense from being the main guy to gain the zone and win battles.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ushl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>33. Joey Anderson, RW, USA U18 (USHL)</strong><br>

<strong>GP:</strong> 57 | <strong>G:</strong> 20 | <strong>A:</strong> 29</p>
<p>Anderson was known at times this season for being the third wheel on the USNTDP's top line with Clayton Keller and Kieffer Bellows. However, he was solid in his own right and provided versatility to that top line and team as a whole. Anderson gets the greasy goals and shows a great work ethic and willingness to attack the net. He isn't all elbows, though, as he has above-average skill and very good speed and can move the puck around just fine. He was never carried by the big duo he played with, as he often made quality plays to keep the puck alive and occasionally made a top-level skill play. He was often relied upon as a penalty killer, and he often proved to be a shorthanded scoring threat. He's committed to Minnesota-Duluth for the 2016-17 season.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>34. Will Bitten, RW, Flint (OHL)</strong><br>

<strong>GP:</strong> 67 | <strong>G:</strong> 30 | <strong>A:</strong> 35</p>
<p>In what was a disastrous season for Flint, Bitten was a bright spot who stood out as one of the CHL's top 17-year-old forwards. He's an explosive skater who brings a lot of energy to every shift due to his speed and competitiveness. He's also a skilled offensive player who can make high difficulty plays with the puck and shows creativity with his passes. He can force some plays and could smarten up on a few decisions, but overall, he is a big net positive offensively. His defensive play rates as solid and improved a fair amount as the season went on, to the point that he was a critical defensive player for Canada at the under-18 world championship. Bitten shows the speed and work ethic to be a fine penalty killer, and though he'll occasionally cheat off his man on the point, overall he plays with the intensity you want in a checker.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 65 | <strong>G:</strong> 17 | <strong>A:</strong> 34</p>
<p>Kyrou had an up-and-down season. In his best moments, he shows high-end pro potential; in his worst stretches, he's invisible offensively and even a liability. His skating and puck handling are of the game-breaking variety, and he can create highlight-reel moments with the best of them. Kyrou often beats defenders to the outside with his speed and shows great edge work. Now, on to the bad: Kyrou has a slight build, is very shy in terms of physical play and often loses his 1-on-1 battles. He cheats defensively and can be a liability in his own end. There is a lot of risk and reward in his projection.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/khl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>DOB:</strong> 5/25/97 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 5-8 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 161<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 25 | <strong>G:</strong> 7 | <strong>A:</strong> 5</p>
<p>Polunin had a breakout season after going undrafted last summer, skating a regular shift for his KHL team and playing in the top six for Russia at the WJC as an underage player. There are reasons to doubt him, however. He has never been a top player on a team or in a tournament, he's 5-foot-8, and he isn'tan All-World skill player. But in every game this season, he looked impressive for an 18-year-old. Polunin is a good to very good skater with a quick burst out of every stride and a dangerous top gear. He's great in open ice and able to dangle defenders with consistency. Polunin is very smart in terms of his creativity with the puck and being able to set his teammates up with tough passes. He can also finish chances from a distance. On the downside, he is a one-dimensional player in terms of his play away from the puck, but he will hang around the net area and get in tight when he anticipates a chance.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 56 | <strong>G:</strong> 23 | <strong>A:</strong> 45</p>
<p>The former second overall QMJHL draft pick is a highly talented and competitive forward. He brings a solid base of intangibles to the table, shows a good work ethic every shift and doesn't shy away when the energy level ratchets up a few notches. Laberge is an above-average skater with a very good top gear, which allows him to separate off the rush. He's a creative playmaker who can dangle and create the occasional highlight-reel moment as well as consistently set his teammates up for scoring chances. He's not the best defensively, which is concerning as a center, but I see him as a player trending upward.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ushl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>38. Ryan Lindgren, D, USA U18 (USHL)</strong><br>

<strong>GP:</strong> 54 | <strong>G:</strong> 4 | <strong>A:</strong> 16</p>
<p>Lindgren has been a touted name coming up through the ranks for a few years. Although he wasn't a dominant force this season, he was a pretty solid two-way defender for the USNTDP. He's a good skater who can join the rush effectively, and he has the mobility to stay with quick forwards. He handles the puck well and shows the occasional flash of top-level skill, but he mostly contains himself to good, short passes. Lindgren is a tough competitor who battles for pucks as hard as anybody and will lay out some crushing hits on occasion. His decision-making isn't perfect, but it's not a huge hole in his game. His shot could be a little better too. Lindgren is committed to the University of Minnesota starting next season.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 65 | <strong>G:</strong> 35 | <strong>A:</strong> 46</p>
<p>One of the top-scoring under-18 players in the CHL this season, the former No. 2 overall pick in his OHL draft was a dominant player for long stretches. I polled a lot of scouts about Mascherin, and the common themes were "goal scorer" and "elite shot." While Mascherin can snipe it from a distance, he has other strong attributes to his game. He has above-average puck skills and shows great overall offensive instincts. Mascherin is able to find teammates, anticipate where the play is going and find ways to put himself in the right position. Overall, his team dominates the puck when he's on the ice. He's small, but he's a very strong and competitive forward who wins more battles than he should for a smaller guy. Mascherin's biggest flaw is his skating. He is a roughly average skater and notably below-average for a smaller player, in terms of his speed and first-step agility. This hinders his defensive play and prevents him from being too dangerous rushing through the neutral zone.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ushl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>40. Riley Tufte, LW, Fargo (USHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 4/10/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-5 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 205<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 27 | <strong>G:</strong> 10 | <strong>A:</strong> 4</p>
<p>Tufte played much of the season in the high school ranks for Blaine High (Minnesota), where he was outstanding (scoring 78 points in 25 games), even when you adjust for the lower quality of competition, compared to Canadian junior leagues or the USHL. Tufte measures in at around 6-foot-5, but he skates like a 5-foot-10 forward. He has an incredibly explosive stride and first step; combined with his frame, that makes him a headache for defensemen when he's coming down the wing. Tufte's hands are above average, with good hand-eye coordination for a big man and a quality level of creativity and vision. His defensive play was fine at the high school ranks, but against the higher level of competition in the USHL, some holes were exposed in the way he plays his position. As always with top high school prospects, questions of pace and quality of competition will loom over Tufte until he shows it at a consistent level versus better players. But given the struggles he has gone through, one has to be confident that he has the willpower to find a way to prove himself. He is committed to Minnesota-Duluth for the 2016-17 season.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 68 | <strong>G:</strong> 13 | <strong>A:</strong> 46</p>
<p>A Toms River, New Jersey, native, Dineen was one of the biggest surprises of the season, as he came out of relative nowhere (he was considered only a decent prospect in the summer) to be one of the top-scoring defensemen in the CHL. Dineen has good raw offensive qualities; he brings above-average mobility and hands to the table. However, the biggest reason for his success is his hockey sense. Dineen is one of the smartest players in the draft. He takes the extra second to make a play and evades pressure as well as anyone. His timing on his passes is always spot-on, and he knows when and when not to jump up into the attack. In fact, his hockey sense has allowed him to be a not only competent but also useful defensive defenseman, in spite of his size. He isn't an overly flashy player, but he has shown this season that he can be a very effective two-way defenseman. Teams that can overlook his size might land a gem.</p><p></p>

<p>Mete was a favorite of mine this season. On a team full of superstar prospects in London, he found a way to consistently stand out. Mete is one of the best skaters in this draft class. He can explode up the ice and lead a rush as well as anybody in the CHL, and he is quite agile. His puck skills aren't high-end, but he can make some plays in open ice, and he moves the puck around well. He's a small defender, but he is actually quite solid defensively and was often relied on by London in key defensive situations. Although he isn't perfect in that area, mainly due to his size, his skating and quality hockey IQ allow him to make some stops. He'll need to bulk up a ton, but he has significant pro upside.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 40 | <strong>G:</strong> 14 | <strong>A:</strong> 30</p>
<p>Lindstrom is not the first player many would think of when they look for a forward to score a goal, yet he has been a very consistent and reliable two-way forward the past few years. In the Swedish 1998 age group, he was the top-line center. He's often one of the first guys over the boards to kill a penalty, in spite of below-average size, which is because of his very good hockey sense and work ethic. He's no slouch offensively, either. Lindstrom has above-average vision and can occasionally flash a tick above that level. He's hard on the puck and can maintain possession fine, thanks to his competitiveness and quality puck skills. He isn't a slow skater, but he's certainly not a fast one, and that's a disappointment, given his size.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/whl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 46 | <strong>G:</strong> 17 | <strong>A:</strong> 16</p>
<p>One of the Kelowna's top players this season, Dube played all situations effectively. He's a very good skater with a powerful first few steps, and he brings a high level of energy to most shifts. Despite subpar size, he battles for pucks effectively, kills penalties well and will throw a few hits around too. When he's on his scoring game, he can dangle, set his teammates up and score from outside the paint. You see flashes of top-end skill from Dube, but it isn't there consistently, which makes me wonder if he has the top-level offensive hockey sense to put up big numbers in the NHL. He probably ends up as a bottom-six forward in the NHL.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/shl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 41 | <strong>G:</strong> 5 | <strong>A:</strong> 16</p>
<p>Although not a highlight-reel type of defenseman, Moverare is consistently solid. He's big, but there is a lot more to his game than size. He is a quality puck mover who can make good touch plays and doesn't panic under pressure. Defensively, he understands the position, doesn't shy from leaning on his checks and wins a lot of battles. His skating isn't the best, and though he is still able to rush the puck, thanks to his hockey IQ, I've seen him get burned by speed on the defensive end more than once. But overall, he is a quality two-way defenseman who doesn't take anything off the table.</p><p></p>

<p>Hajek has been a top prospect for a few years. He was one of the top 16-year-old players in recent memory to be a regular in the top Czech league, and he was one of Saskatoon's best players this season. Hajek is a fantastic skater, one of the very best in this draft class. He closes his gaps well on his checks, evades pressure and is a threat offensively by activating off the point or jumping into the rush. He moves the puck efficiently, shows some creativity on the power play and is a steady positional player. He is also able to defend his off-wing very effectively. Hajek's hands aren't great, but his IQ lets him get his points, as he opens lanes so well with timing, patience and skating ability. Hajek has some room on his frame to bulk up, and he shows the intangibles to battle for pucks and throw his weight around.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 56 | <strong>G:</strong> 25 | <strong>A:</strong> 19</p>
<p>Golyshev had a breakout season as a 20-year-old, as he scored the fourth-most goals in the KHL and carried his team to a postseason appearance. He's a gifted all-around offensive player who displays plus hands, good in-tight coordination and overall creativity. His best tool is arguably his shot, as he can wire chances home from the circles with consistency. He isn't as dynamic a skater as you'd like for a 5-foot-8 player, but he is certainly above-average and has an aggressive element to how he plays, and that lets him play up past his size. Although it seems like he's one of the more NHL-ready players on the list, one reason I'm not ranking Golyshev too highly is that his KHL deal runs through 2019, and there is no Russian transfer agreement.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 67 | <strong>G:</strong> 24 | <strong>A:</strong> 49</p>
<p>Among the top OHL scorers for long stretches of the season, Raddysh was a shots-on-goal machine in the process. Although he was helped by being on a super line with <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-coyotes">Arizona Coyotes</a> prospect Dylan Strome and likely first-rounder Alex DeBrincat, Raddysh was very impressive in his own right. He is a power winger. He works hard every shift to win battles while also showing above-average puck skills. He reads the play very well and shows quality vision and offensive instincts. Raddysh's defensive play is about average; he's the kind of player who sacrifices his body for his team but could improve his positioning. His first step can use some work, as he's got a bit of a sluggish stride but decent leg strength.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 48 | <strong>G:</strong> 8 | <strong>A:</strong> 9</p>
<p>Bratt was a useful player for AIK this season and one of the better under-18 scorers in the Allsvenskan the past few seasons. Bratt is a small yet exciting offensive player with dynamic qualities and an above-average skater with an explosive first step. When you add his impressive puck skills, he can be tough to handle coming through the neutral zone for defenders. He's a pretty smart two-way player as well. Bratt makes good decisions with the puck and sees the ice well, and despite his frame, he shows the ability to be quite solid defensively, even killing penalties in international play. He isn't the most physical player, and with a long road of bulking up in front of him, his drafting team will need to be patient.</p><p></p>

<p>Younger brother of Jordan Greenway (who went 50th overall to the Wild in 2015), James is a very interesting prospect who was a top defenseman this season for the USNTDP. He stands 6-foot-5 and is by no means a tree on defense. Greenway skates fine for a big man, is capable with the puck and can pull off the occasional high-skill play on the rush or off a pinch. However, he's more of a stay-at-home player who can lean on opponents and clog up traffic. You see games in which Greenway can be absolutely dominant as a two-way defender, but those moments are inconsistent. He can be susceptible to brain cramps, in terms of his coverage, and he can cough the puck up by trying to do too much or getting caught in a forecheck.</p><p></p>

<p>This is the third season in a row I'm listing Aho here, so I've made peace with the likelihood that he will go undrafted yet again, but here we are (and he is not to be confused with the Finnish forward of the same name, who went 35th overall to the Hurricanes last year). Aho was a solid contributor for the top team in the SHL but missed the WJC due to injury. He is a very mobile skater with top-end hockey sense, moves the puck well, and has some creativity in his game. The main knock against Aho has been that he's a small defenseman, which hinders his NHL potential. That is true, and he doesn't project as a top-end player or defensive stalwart, but his IQ allows him to be an effective stickchecker and to execute proper positioning.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 40 | <strong>G:</strong> 0 | <strong>A:</strong> 4</p>
<p>Hronek has been a decent regular in the top men's league in the Czech Republic this season, but his best showing came at the WJC. His lackluster point production in professional play is not indicative of his potential, as he is an offense-tilted defenseman. Hronek has quick feet and is able to close his gaps and join the rush effectively. His solid hands and skating allow him to be quite elusive. He has a decent work ethic but his thin, small frame holds him back from winning battles, and he can be manhandled in the defensive zone. His defense isn't horrible, but improving the physical aspects of his game will go a long way toward rectifying those issues.</p><p></p>

<p>Son of former No. 17 overall pick <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/189/ulf-dahlen">Ulf Dahlen</a>, Jonathan was one of the best players on his team. One Swedish scout referred to him as a "mama's boy Swede." I'm still trying to figure out exactly what that means, but he said it in context while discussing how Dahlen has a high level of skill and hockey intelligence, so I'll go with that. Dahlen sees the ice well, showing well above-average vision as a playmaker. He also thinks the game quickly, showing the poise of a professional player already. He's not an incredibly gifted skater, which is the biggest issue in his offensive arsenal. He could also stand to be a little tougher on his checks and in one-on-one matchups, as he loses more battles than he should.</p><p></p>

<p>Allard was a leader for Chicoutimi this season, steadily progressing as the season went along and becoming one of the top defensemen in the Q. Allard thinks the game at a very high level, showing a high panic threshold with the puck. He makes creative plays on the power play, transitions the puck very well, and is able to hold on to the puck for an extra second to make the right play. He's not a standout defensive player, but is able to be solid positionally and stay with his checks. Allard's skating could use a little work, as he lacks an explosive first step.</p><p></p>

<p>The massive blueliner has been a lightning rod in the prospect community for a number of years, with a wide variance of opinions. I've heard scouts who wouldn't use a pick in the first two rounds on him, and others who consider him a top-10 talent. He stands 6-7 and is a pretty impressive skater and puck mover for such a big man. He's not particularly dynamic in either area, but he shows a quality athletic toolkit. Stanley leans on opponents with his large frame to win battles and gets in shooting lanes pretty well, and disrupts play with his long reach. Stanley's hockey IQ isn't sublime; while he's not a liability there, he doesn't display top-end puck-moving instincts to make him a real power-play threat. There's some offensive upside, but it's pretty evident how his bread will be buttered.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 50 | <strong>G:</strong> 19 | <strong>A:</strong> 19</p>
<p>Rasanen's point totals weren't too gaudy this season in the top Finnish junior league, but he's been an important part of the Finnish 1998 age group the last few years. He's a very smart center who can slow the game down and create chances while appearing to exert minimal effort. He can deke defenders, but he's more effective making quick passes and beating opponents with pace. Rasanen is at his best as a playmaker, but he takes his shots when he gets a lane and has a decent cannon when he does so. His skating is his most noticeable hole to me; his top gear is below average, and he can have trouble pushing defenders back too far off the blue line on a rush. He is quite good defensively, often being leaned on for critical defensive situations and faceoffs.</p><p></p>

<p>Brother of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/nj/new-jersey-devils">New Jersey Devils</a> prospect John Quenneville (and second cousin of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> coach Joel Quenneville), David is still as skilled as he was when he was a top pick in his WHL bantam draft, but everyone else grew a few inches and he stayed 5-8. Quenneville has put up big scoring numbers and is one of the more skilled offensive defensemen in this year's draft. He's a very agile skater who can escape pressure well and activate into the attack. His puck moving is exceptional. He thinks the game quickly, has the hands to evade pressure, and doesn't shy away from getting up into the attack. He doesn't have a cannon from the point, but he always finds a way to get it on net and create issues for the opposition. Despite his size, I've seen Quenneville throw an occasional big hit, and he doesn't shy away from puck battles. Defensively, he's not a huge hole due to his IQ, but his size limits what he can do there.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 47 | <strong>G:</strong> 22 | <strong>A:</strong> 31</p>
<p>Kuokkanen was a top scorer in the Finnish junior league and was consistently impressive during under-18 international play for Finland. He's not an outstanding offensive player in any one regard, but he's a well-rounded threat who can play center or wing, though projects more as a winger. Kuokkanen has a strong burst in his skating and is able to ratchet up to a solid top gear. He can make skill plays, move it quickly up the ice, and maintain possession in tight spaces. He has a decent power game in his arsenal, as I've seen him drive the net front area and protect the puck effectively. Defensively, he cheats a little and could stand to clean up that part of his game in order to be a more complete player as the competition level ramps up.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/khl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 20 | <strong>G:</strong> 3 | <strong>A:</strong> 7</p>
<p>I was surprised Rykov wasn't drafted last season. It was possibly due to the "Russian factor," and while he didn't have a mind-blowing season, he was solid for an 18-year-old skating in the KHL and had a good WJC. I think any NHL org would benefit from his skills, and he's cleared the hurdle of being good enough to be worth the risk of a draft pick late in the second round or early in the third. Rykov doesn't have one standout ability; he's not going to blaze by on a rush, or lay a crushing hit, but I don't see a glaring weakness in his game. He skates well, can move the puck, has some offensive creativity, and is a reliable positional defender who has shown the ability to check the best players in his age group as well as older players.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 62 | <strong>G:</strong> 19 | <strong>A:</strong> 43</p>
<p>Stransky was pretty good for Prince Albert in his second WHL season, but he had an average performance at the WJC for the Czech Republic. He is a gifted puck handler who can make difficult, coordinated plays seem easy, and is an unselfish playmaker who makes soft touch plays around the offensive zone to move the puck quickly. His offensive hockey sense gives you optimism about his projection. On the negative side, he is a bit scrawny and will need to bulk up a lot over the next few years. He also isn't the most gifted skater, having a bit of a sluggish first step and an overall rough stride. He will need patience on the part of the organization that picks him, but he does show some NHL capabilities.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 72 | <strong>G:</strong> 28 | <strong>A:</strong> 45</p>
<p>After missing a big chunk of the previous season due to injury, Gregor was very impressive in 2015-16, being one of the top-scoring under-18 players in the CHL. He's a pretty good skater, bringing above-average speed and agility to the table. He's a tenacious player who buzzes around the ice and stays on his man. Gregor can go east-west with the puck, and he is a smart playmaker who has soft hands, can spot the open seams in the ice and get the puck to his teammates. He's a two-way forward who can kill penalties well. One knock on him is his size, and while he's not the biggest player, he works hard to win defensive battles and get in lanes. He's been one of the big risers on my board this season.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/shl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 46 | <strong>G:</strong> 17 | <strong>A:</strong> 16</p>
<p>A quick look at Steen's basic stats would probably leave some folks less than enthusiastic. He's small and hasn't put up giant scoring numbers this season at any level or tournament, yet every time I saw him I came away thinking he's a real NHL prospect. He did manage to work his way into a regular role for an SHL team for a good portion of the season and playoffs, so I'm not alone in that opinion. Steen is a good to a very good skater. He's an energetic player, and wins battles thanks to that work ethic and having the speed to pressure opponents. His skill is not at an All-World level, but he certainly has solid puck skills and vision, and can pull off some high-level plays on occasion. Steen is also useful defensively, killing penalties at the international level and in junior play before his promotion to the SHL side.</p><p></p>

<p>The first overall pick in the 2014 QMJHL draft, Green has been a quality part of the top-four rotation for Saint John the last two seasons. He hasn't been spectacular, though, with just flashes of top-end play. He's a natural offensive player, with shifty feet and above-average puck skills. He can join a rush very effectively, and shows good overall offensive creativity and instincts. Green struggled at times with his decision-making at both ends this season, coming along better in the second half. He's not a top defender, but he was capable in the Q this season, exhibiting fine work ethic even if the technical side of his game needs work.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 39 | <strong>G:</strong> 12 | <strong>A:</strong> 19</p>
<p>One of the players hurt most by the Russian doping scandal was Kayumov, who had been one of the top players on the new Russian under-18 program throughout the season. He's small, but every other element of his game impresses. Kayumov is a very good skater, displaying above-average to high-end speed and acceleration. He's able to slow the game down with the puck, making deft touch plays and evading pressure. Kayumov is a game-breaking offensive talent, and he creates a lot of his own opportunities. Despite his size, he's shown that he can be a useful penalty-killer based on his speed and can even win some battles. He has the intangibles to push himself past his physical deficiencies if a team is willing to take a shot on him this summer.</p><p></p>

<strong>DOB:</strong> 7/5/97 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-0 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 189<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 35 | <strong>G:</strong> 4 | <strong>A:</strong> 5</p>
<p>Carlsson is a re-entry player, and one who I also had ranked in the latter portions of my top 100 last season. He was solid as a regular player for Brynas this season, but doesn't stand out at either end of the rink. Offensively, he displays solid-to-average stick skills, with fine mobility and straight-line speed. This season he showed a little more creativity than I saw from him in the past. His hockey IQ is what makes him go. He's a very smart and patient puck mover, and on defense he makes stops using good positioning and stick play. He can also win some battles, and is able to kill penalties. Carlsson gets beat a little too much by speed, but it's not a huge issue.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 46 | <strong>G:</strong> 17 | <strong>A:</strong> 16</p>
<p>After coming into 2015-16 with a fair amount of hype, Gettinger never really found his offensive groove, and I'd count him among the more underwhelming prospects this season. He's a 6-foot-5 forward with skill, which immediately draws attention. The skill isn't overwhelming -- more in the "slightly above-average" bucket -- but it's very good for a man his size. Gettinger displays solid vision with the puck, has pretty good defensive awareness for a player his age, and can kill penalties at a quality level. I don't hate his skating given his size, but he has a rough first step and overall has to develop that area of his game a fair amount to have a shot at the NHL. He isn't the most physical player, which can underplay his size advantage, and scouts point to issues regarding his willingness to compete and maintain proper fitness.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ushl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 46 | <strong>G:</strong> 3 | <strong>A:</strong> 23</p>
<p>Krys was another prospect I thought underperformed relative to expectations this season. He had a fine season but never really established himself as a take-control-of-the-game kind of player for the USNTDP. Krys can "own the puck," per one scout, with his great vision, creativity and skill. He shows the ability to quarterback the power play with his poise and IQ. He's an agile skater with above-average speed as well. Krys' 5-foot-11 frame is an obvious concern, coupled with the fact he's not a high-end defensive player and makes the odd hiccup; this raises notable concerns about his projection. He is committed to Boston University starting next season.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 65 | <strong>G:</strong> 1 | <strong>A:</strong> 26</p>
<p>Niemelainen was a fine two-way player for Saginaw this season. He's a fantastic skater for a defender of his size, moving effortlessly around the ice. His skill isn't high-end, but he moves the puck at a solid-to-average level, showing good hands and coordination for a player his size, and decent offensive instincts. Niemelainen is a hard-working player who will use his size to his advantage, but he needs to bulk up a fair amount. One criticism has been that he can look somewhat bland, never particularly dominating a game or making elite-level plays at either end. Since Niemelainen was loaned to Saginaw this season from his club team in Finland, he may not be restricted to play in the CHL the next two seasons, so his drafting team could choose to develop him in a pro league elsewhere.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 63 | <strong>G:</strong> 24 | <strong>A:</strong> 27</p>
<p>Katchouk showed notable improvements in his game this season, even in terms of his month to month play. Katchouk is a player who bleeds intangibles. He is an intense competitor who brings it every shift, and walks the line between "physical" and "agitator." He's not all hits and fists, as Katchouk is a decent skater, with above-average vision, shooting touch and a decent-sized frame. As the season went on, he showed more confidence and creativity with the puck. He shows good strength for a player his age, and gets to the tough areas of the ice pretty effectively. Surprisingly -- given his tools and playing style -- he was not relied upon too much to kill penalties this season, but one expects he will do so as he transitions into the pro ranks.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 63 | <strong>G:</strong> 12 | <strong>A:</strong> 19</p>
<p>Though he scored just a tad over a half-point per game, don't forget that Pu was buried on a deep London forward group, and showed well in a limited role. Pu skates very well for a player with a pro-sized body. He can jet through the neutral zone and pressure opponents well. He's got a decent touch with the puck, able to handle in tight spaces just fine and flash some top-level plays. He can play center reliably and be a quality penalty killer. Pu is a very bright individual, but his hockey IQ hasn't shown well at times.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 72 | <strong>G:</strong> 37 | <strong>A:</strong> 39</p>
<p>Phillips was a top-20 scorer in the WHL this season as a rookie and a big part of Victoria being one of the top teams. The reason why he's not going in the top 45 is that he can't get onto every ride at an amusement park, coming in at about 5-foot-7 and 140 pounds. He's a very dynamic offensive player, however. Phillips is one of the better skaters in this draft class. While his top gear is not elite, his ability to elude pressure and his side-to-side movements are elite. He's a very shifty puck handler with good vision, and despite his size, he can be very difficult to check in open ice. Phillips is a battler who goes to the net, although overall, his off-the-puck play is -- and will continue to be -- a significant issue.</p><p></p>

<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5434/ryan-johansen">Ryan Johansen</a>'s brother took huge steps forward in his second WHL season, being one of Kelowna's most important players. He shows quality hockey sense, effectively moving the puck out of his end and on the man advantage. He doesn't have a "wow"-level caliber of skill, but he always makes decisions with the puck to put his team in a position to succeed and is able to hold onto it for that extra second. He's very solid defensively, showing great work ethic to win pucks and get in lanes, as well as fine positional play. Johansen's biggest issue is his skating. He's notably below average in that department, with a sluggish stride, and he can get beat wide by quicker forwards.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 41 | <strong>G:</strong> 6 | <strong>A:</strong> 6</p>
<p>Korshkov got a lot of attention after a very good performance at the WJC, and he has been a decent bottom-six forward for his KHL team after going undrafted by NHL clubs the past two years. Korshkov is a towering power forward, with a strong 6-foot-4 frame that he uses to bulldoze his way to the front of the net and win many battles along the boards. He's a good skater for a man his size, showing excellent balance. Korshkov's hands won't dazzle, but he can make coordinated plays to avoid a check here or there. He'll move the puck at a fair level, and he isn't just a bump-and-grind big man.</p><p></p>

<p>A two-way center who was relied on to play key minutes, Frederic was inconsistent on the offensive end. He has a big, strong frame and is quite effective in one-on-one battles. He's a pretty good penalty killer who gets in lanes and wins pucks. He also is a short-handed scoring threat. He's got solid puck skills, even if he's not a spectacular puck handler. His skating, on the other hand, worries me a little. He's not really fast, relying on his power game -- as opposed to a quick burst -- to get to the net. He is committed to the University of Wisconsin starting next season.</p><p></p>

<p>Lockwood didn't put up great numbers this season, so consider this one more of a scouting feel, as I always came away impressed when I saw Lockwood play this season. He has high-end offensive talent, as he skates very well and buzzes around the ice with speed and energy every shift. He is confident with the puck and can execute difficult plays with consistency. Lockwood is better at attacking directly than being a playmaker, although he has decent vision. His off-puck play can use a lot of work. He is not the most physically imposing player nor does he win a ton of battles. His defensive positioning could also be described as lackluster, at times. He's committed to the University of Michigan starting next season.</p><p></p>

<p>Bastian served as one third of one of the best lines in the CHL this season, playing alongside Michael McLeod and Alexander Nylander. While he was the third wheel on that line, he's still a very good prospect, in his own right. A two-way forward with power elements in his game, he shows solid stick skills and has the ability to make creative offensive plays to maintain possession. Bastian is a big, strong forward who grinds out battles and plays every shift hard. I don't love his skating, and given that he doesn't have high-end offensive touch with the puck, I'm not sure I see him as having the talent to rate as a potential top-six forward for an NHL team.</p><p></p>

<p>Overall, it was a solid rookie campaign for Kopacka in the OHL, despite some peaks and valleys. Kopacka is a good skater with an explosive first step, and he's dangerous when coming through the neutral zone with the puck. He shows the ability to make plays to his teammates, has above-average puck skills and can score from a distance. As alluded to above, his offense was not always there this season, at times looking invisible for long stretches. He has a decent frame but isn't the most physical player or a guy you would put over the boards first to kill a penalty. He has good long-term upside, but he will require patience from an organization drafting him.</p><p></p>

<p>Mahura missed nearly the entire season due to a knee injury, so this is a mostly scouting-based call, though he did play in the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament and WHL playoffs. Mahura is not incredibly dynamic, but he is a very useful two-way defenseman. He's an easy, four-way skater who can get up into the attack and recovers very easily on his backward motions. His puck movement is solid, and he shows the ability to be an average power-play quarterback, with some flashes of top-level creativity. Mahura exhibits decent grit in battles and has the hockey IQ to play his position. His decisions aren't perfect, as I've seen situations where he tries to get too cute or misses his check, but that is not a major issue.</p><p></p>

<p>Let's talk about Sean Day. Renowned for being named the fourth "exceptional" player by Hockey Canada, following <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5160/john-tavares">John Tavares</a>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3114717/aaron-ekblad">Aaron Ekblad</a> and Connor McDavid. Renowned, as well, for being in the same sentence with those names -- first overall NHL draft picks, all of them -- for only that reason. On the plus side, he's an elite skater with unbelievable four-way quickness for a big man. Day is a creative puck mover who can outlet the puck well and make plays in tight spaces. On his best days, Day is a calm, efficient puck mover who can win some battles and make some stops. On his worst days, Day is shooting his team in the foot with poor puck management and positioning. Despite all his talents, he has shown notably little progression during the past 12 months and is a very inconsistent player. He has also had issues controlling his weight and maintaining proper fitness.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 50 | <strong>G:</strong> 12 | <strong>A:</strong> 28</p>
<p>Cholowski was Chilliwack's best puck mover this season, and while he's a long-term project type of prospect, he does have the upside to make an NHL's team patience worth it. Cholowski has above-average offensive tools across the board. He has the top speed to be able to rush the puck effectively and can evade pressure off his edges just fine. Cholowski is a very smart puck mover, showing good poise on his outlets and power-play decisions. He possesses solid coordination with the puck and can execute above-average passes. Cholowski's physical game, however, is a significant issue. He is undersized and can have a real tough time winning one-on-one battles. Defensively, he's not a world killer, either. He is committed to St. Cloud State starting in the 2017-18 season.</p><p></p>

<p>Somppi had a somewhat better than expected season in the QMJHL, being one of Halifax's best players and becoming heavily leaned on especially after San Jose's top prospect, Timo Meier, was dealt. "Toolsy playmaker," said one scout. "He's still a little bit raw, but you see he can make a lot of good plays." Somppi shows pretty good passing skills. He likes to set up his teammates and passes up shooting opportunities to make a play. He's a solid skater who can get up and down the ice fine. His work ethic is quality, as he can win battles and will play his defensive position on the back check. Is he the most consistent offensive threat? Probably not, but he does show you he has what it takes to play with pros down the lines.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/whl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<p>Burke took gigantic steps forward in his development this season, after going undrafted in 2014-15 to being one of the WHL's top scorers. Burke is a very good skater, showing above-average to plus agility, acceleration and top gear. His ability to elude pressure and carry the puck up the ice is a difference-maker for him. Burke excels with the puck on his stick and is one of the better playmakers in the CHL, consistently executing on tough passes and putting pucks in good spots. Even if he has a tendency at times to overpass, he was at well over an assist per game this season. Burke's size and defensive game are issues. He measures in at just 5-foot-10, is not incredibly physical and doesn't project as a top-end penalty killer, by any means.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/qmjhl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 68 | <strong>G:</strong> 31 | <strong>A:</strong> 46</p>
<p>Fortier improved significantly in his 18-year-old season with Halifax, serving as assistant captain and putting Halifax on his back some nights especially after Timo Meier was traded. Fortier has big-time speed, being able to create a lot of scoring chances with how he turns defenders coming through the neutral zone. Fortier can't go east-west as well as he can go north-south, but he's certainly got a quality pair of hands on him too. He can make creative plays in tight spaces and angle out defenders well. He'll create at a fair level for his teammates, making the odd "wow" play, and has a solid wrist shot too. Fortier's off-the-puck play is a significant issue. He's small and not the best in one-on-one battles. He also isn't the most useful player when it comes to defensive positioning.</p><p></p>

<p>The son of NHL journeyman <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/799/cliff-ronning">Cliff Ronning</a>, Ty Ronning was one of the most improved players in the CHL this season, putting up big goal-scoring numbers and leading Vancouver in most offensive categories. Ronning plays the game with a ton of energy. I don't love the technical part of his stride, having a bit of an awkward lean, but he gets to where he needs to go in straight lines very well and shows an overall impressive top gear. Ronning is small but doesn't shy away from the rough stuff, all while keeping his penalty minutes low. He shows above-average puck skills and solid overall coordination, and he can make plays to his teammates. Ronning also features a high-end wrist shot, showing the ability to finish plays from faceoff-dot distance.</p><p></p>

<p>Smith's counting numbers might not jump off the screen to anyone who does a quick Google search, but keep in mind, he was a top player on one of the worst OHL teams. Smith is one of the most physical players in the draft. He wins most of the one-on-one battles he engages in and can fight back pucks from opponent's possession as well as nearly any junior player. He shows a solid pair of mitts too, being able to generate some space for himself with the puck. Neither his speed nor his puck skills are amazing, but he'll be able to carry himself in those areas with pros. His discipline is a major issue, as you often hear scouts describe him as "reckless" and a "headache" in terms of the penalties he takes. His overall decision-making could stand to be a lot better. However, he does find a way to agitate opponents quite well.</p><p></p>

<p>The son of longtime NHL player <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/1180/robert-reichel">Robert Reichel</a> (who was also his coach this season at the under-18 level), he was solid in international play and was a regular in the top Czech league this season. There are a fair amount of tools to like from Reichel. He is a 6-foot-1 center with above-average speed and can make skilled plays with the puck. He's not a dynamic highlight reel, but versus his age group, he has usually found ways to stand out. Reichel can show good vision with the puck and has some creativity too. His off-the-puck play isn't horrible, and while he'll make the odd good defensive play and win some battles, there is a lot of room for improvement there -- particularly if he wants to stay down the middle.</p><p></p>

<p>Wahlgren was one of the top scorers in the top Sweden junior league and was impressive as well for Sweden's under-18 team. He's a very good skater who plays with a real intensity and constantly pressures opponents. He can be a handful to take the puck away from and kills penalties effectively due to his speed, work ethic and IQ. He's not an insignificant puck handler by any means, as Wahlgren can show the occasional flash of skill, but he won't be a primary puck carrier on a scoring line, by any means. Overall though, he shows pretty good anticipation and decision-making, rarely working plays that create a negative for his team. He has a shot to be an effective two-way forward as a pro.</p><p></p>

<p>The Florida native has impressed this season in the USHL and several international showings for the U.S. Peeke is a good skater and an extremely fluid and mobile player for a 6-foot-3 defenseman. He evades pressure well to create space on outlets and is able to join the rush fairly effectively. Peeke moves the puck well, showing solid vision and overall offensive instincts. His puck skills are poor, though, and in tight pressure, he can't skate away from challenges. Peeke's defense is fine, with his positioning being a slight issue, but his mobility, size and work ethic allow him to be a quality defender. He is committed to the University of Notre Dame starting next season.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 52 | <strong>G:</strong> 30 | <strong>A:</strong> 45</p>
<p>Lazarev has gone undrafted twice, and I've never had him ranked prior to this season, but he impressed me this season enough to throw him in toward the bottom of my top 100. Lazarev has a very high skill level, and the more time he has spent in North America, the more comfortable he has gotten making skill plays in tight spaces. He's one of the best playmakers in the CHL (albeit, as one of the league's older players), because of how he sees the ice -- but also in terms of how he creates space for himself to dish the puck. He skates fine, with above-average speed and edge work, but given his diminutive size, you hope he would have another gear. Lazarev is also a one-dimensional player, not being able to win many board battles, and his defensive positioning is subpar, at best. I think the offensive upside is worth a flier even if he is a bit of a long shot.</p><p></p>

<p>Morrison was his USHL team's leading goal scorer and point producer. Morrison features a pro-level shot and finished on nearly 30 percent of his shots this season. While that obviously is not a shooting percentage that he will maintain, he can absolutely finish chances from a distance. Scouts I've talked to praise his skating, but when I saw him multiple times this season, I never saw a truly high-level gear; it looked more overall average to me, but you see the odd good flash. I'm not a huge believer in his hockey sense, but I still rank him due to his frame, his touch with the puck and his shot; and people I trust around the USHL seem to think there is something there. He is committed to the University of Notre Dame starting next season.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 62 | <strong>G:</strong> 8 | <strong>A:</strong> 29</p>
<p>Lajoie held steady this season from his breakout campaign in 2014-15, continuing to be a solid two-way defender for Swift Current. He doesn't have any particularly elite skills, but he does a variety of things pretty well. He's a good skater, showing above-average skating traits in terms of ease of stride and speed, and he is capable of jumping up into the attack. With the puck, he's able to make a play whether moving or carrying it. Defensively, he can be relied upon to battle for possession, get in shooting lanes and maintain his position at a fair level. Swift Current has leaned on him as an all-situations defender. Lajoie can be a bit bland, though. He is not really a player you rely on for a crucial play or some big, powerful defender that can kill a penalty by himself.</p><p></p>

<p>One of the bigger risers this season, Maksimovich was a former top scorer on his GTHL team (ahead of top prospects such as Michael McLeod), but he never really emerged at the OHL level until this season. He is a highly gifted puck handler, possessing coordination, creativity and the quick-twitch abilities to make plays in tight spaces. He has great hockey sense, showing rapid decision-making and above-average vision. Maksimovich's size is an issue. He works hard, but he is 5-foot-9 and isn't the best defensively, either. He's a lot slower than the ideal skill forwards in his height range. He is fine moving on his edges but lacks a true breakaway gear.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 36 | <strong>G:</strong> 14 | <strong>A:</strong> 18</p>
<p>Thompson surged up draft boards this season after putting up big point totals as a freshman. While a lot of his scoring was due to heavy power-play production, which isn't always very predictive of talent, there is certainly a fair amount to like about Thompson's game. He's a skilled big man. Thompson shows the ability to make decent offensive plays, displaying strong coordination and puck-movement ability for a 6-foot-5 player. Thompson also has a big shot, often being used this season as a trigger man on the point for Connecticut. His defensive hockey sense is fair, as he was a quality penalty killer during his time with the USNTDP. His skating isn't the best, though. His speed isn't horrible for a big man, but he's not a burner at all. And despite his size, Thompson isn't the most physical player you will find in the draft.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 29 | <strong>G:</strong> 9 | <strong>A:</strong> 5</p>
<p>On the heels of preseason hype, Tuulola stagnated a bit in his development this season. There is a lot to like about the tool kit, as he's a 6-foot-3 forward with talent. Tuulola is a very good puck handler for a big man, able to make skill plays in tight spaces and create space for himself. He has a cannon swing and can finish scoring chances from a significant distance with a forceful wrist shot. His offensive IQ isn't amazing, but it is fine, as Tuulola is able to move the puck around and make the odd good pass. He's effective in front of the net, using his frame and hands to create havoc for goalies. Tuulola's skating is a significant hole in his arsenal due to his sluggish stride. His defense is also a work in progress.</p><p></p>

<strong>GP:</strong> 68 | <strong>G:</strong> 21 | <strong>A:</strong> 28</p>
<p>Ang is a former top pick in the OHL who has been a solid yet unspectacular player for the Petes over the past two seasons. He's a dynamic offensive threat, at times. He's got a great first step and can jet through the neutral zone as well as most CHL forwards. Highlight-reel plays aren't uncommon, as Ang can dangle in open ice and otherwise make moves with the puck. He is a small player who has been dinged in the past for his off-the-puck work, but he was able to steadily get more reliable defensive minutes, even killing penalties along the way. I'm not sold on his hockey IQ being of the top-level variety, as he can force the puck and make some bad decisions at times. He also has some trouble winning battles.</p><p></p>

<p><strong>96. Lukas Doudera, D, HC Trinec (Czech Extraliga)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 1/3/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 5-11 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 165<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 30 | <strong>G:</strong> 0 | <strong>A:</strong> 2</p>
<p>Doudera was a regular all season in the top Czech league and solid in the upper half of the lineup during under-18 international play. He's not a well-rounded player lacking any big-time attributes. Doudera is an above-average skater displaying good technical footwork and skating power in every direction. His coordination with the puck is sound, moving it up the ice competently and making some plays in open ice. He makes simple yet good decisions consistently and is able to open lanes and get pucks through on the power play. He's undersized and not too bulky, which can hinder him in one-on-one battles. His positional play is decent, but there is work to be done before he can be a competent defensive player at high levels.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ushl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>97. Rem Pitlick, C, Muskegon (USHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 4/2/97 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 5-9 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 196<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 56 | <strong>G:</strong> 46 | <strong>A:</strong> 43</p>
<p>Pitlick took gigantic strides this season, advancing from a bottom-six forward on his USHL team and going undrafted last season to being the league's top goal scorer and point producer. He's a pretty good skater who has a strong first step and top gear. Pitlick displays a solid north-south game as he barrels down with energy and attacks the goal, despite being an undersized forward. Stickhandling is solid for Pitlick, and he also has a very good shot, which helped him to clear the 40-goal mark this season. His size is an issue, as is his lack of top-end playmaking ability. He is committed to the University of Minnesota starting next season.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/czech_extraliga.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>98. Marek Zachar, RW, Bill Tygri Liberec (Czech U20)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 6/11/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 5-9 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 146<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 37 | <strong>G:</strong> 10 | <strong>A:</strong> 14</p>
<p>A Google search of Zachar would likely leave some underwhelmed. 5-foot-9? Check. Underwhelming point production in a low tier league? Check. Almost no hype or recognition as a draft prospect? Check. But I'll be darned if every time I watched him I didn't come away thinking there is something more to him. He is one of the better speedsters available in this year's class. Zachar has an explosive first step and a great engine to pressure and win the puck, despite a smaller frame. The question many will have for him: How many plays can he make when his legs aren't moving? And I do think there is some offensive IQ to his game; it just hasn't matured yet. But you see the flashes of creativity and vision from Zachar.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/qmjhl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>99. Vladimir Kuznetsov, RW, Acadie-Bathurst (QMJHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 2/18/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-2 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 210<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 68 | <strong>G:</strong> 25 | <strong>A:</strong> 33</p>
<p>Kuznetsov was the first overall pick in last year's CHL import draft. He was a very solid addition for Acadie-Bathurst, finishing as one of the top-scoring rookies in the CHL this season. He's a skilled winger who can stick handle at above average levels. Kuznetsov has a fine wrist shot and shows good vision from the sideboards. They don't come with any consistently, but he's capable of "wow" moments, thanks to his natural touch and solid speed. Kuznetsov is a big kid at 6-foot-2 and 210 pounds, but he's not all that physical, losing more battles than he should at his size. His effort and positional play on the defensive end could use some work too. The team that drafts him will be getting a good amount of offensive ability but will also know there are a lot of warts to work around.</p><p></p>


<p><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/whl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"></p>
<p><strong>100. Ondrej Vala, D, Kamloops (WHL)</strong><br>
<strong>DOB:</strong> 4/13/98 | <strong>Ht:</strong> 6-5 | <strong>Wt:</strong> 207<br>
<strong>GP:</strong> 72 | <strong>G:</strong> 4 | <strong>A:</strong> 17</p>
<p>At the 100th spot, we have a player that has an intriguing set of skills and tools. Vala is a big defenseman at 6-foot-5, and I think there is some puck-moving upside to his game. Mind you, he's no <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5164/erik-karlsson">Erik Karlsson</a>, but Vala has shown the hockey sense to be competent with the puck. And at the under-18 and WHL levels, he has been effective during his time on the power play. He is decent defensively too, using his big frame to clog up lanes and win battles. His skating is poor, with a real awkward stance and stride. He can be turned horizontally a little too easy by quick forwards, which is a major hurdle that he'll need to overcome on his way to potentially becoming a top prospect.</p><p></p>

<p>Welcome to my second edition of the top 100 NHL draft prospect rankings at ESPN. The following is my analysis of the top prospects eligible to be selected in the 2015 NHL draft.</p>
<p>For a detailed explanation of my ranking methodology, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/12747773/prospect-ranking-methodology-2015-nhl-draft" target="new">click here</a>. Note that players are not separated into tiers, but there is a drop-off in talent that occurs after picks No. 1, 2, and 5, and a small drop-off at 20 before the marginal decrease in talent at each slot continues throughout the rankings.</p>
<p>From discussions throughout the year with scouts, I've heard this class described as a "super class," a simply "good" class and one that's "very average beyond the top two." I fall into the middle of those three.</p>
<p><offer></offer></p>
<p>The talent level of the players in my top 20 is very impressive, and when you go to No. 50 and look at these players' upsides, there are a lot of prospects that can excite an evaluator. However, there are notable concerns with many of the top prospects in the class. Top prospects such as Travis Konecny, Lawson Crouse and Pavel Zacha didn't have the counting numbers one would expect for their skill sets.</p>
<p>Evgeni Svechnikov, Daniel Sprong and Oliver Kylington are concerning away from the puck, while Jeremy Bracco, Nick Merkley, Anthony Beauvillier, Jeremy Roy and Mitchell Vande Sompel have question marks about their size.</p>
<p>Of course, the top two prospects in this class are special. Connor McDavid is the best prospect since <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3114/sidney-crosby">Sidney Crosby</a>. Jack Eichel likely would have been rated ahead of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3114717/aaron-ekblad">Aaron Ekblad</a>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2966500/nail-yakupov">Nail Yakupov</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2562624/ryan-nugent-hopkins">Ryan Nugent-Hopkins</a> in their draft years, although that last one is debatable.</p>
<p>To summarize, the best way I'd describe this draft class is: cautious optimism.</p>

<p><b>1. Connor McDavid<br>
C, Erie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 1/13/97 | Ht: 6-1 | Wt: 190<br>
2014-15 GP: 47 | G: 44 | A: 76</b></p>
<p>Get used to this name; he could end up as one of the faces of hockey for the next 10 to 20 years. McDavid is one of the best pure skaters I've ever seen. It's incredible how effortlessly he accelerates to an extremely dangerous full speed. At the CHL level, if a defenseman was horizontal to him or even had an inch gap they were beat, plain and simple. He'll step into the NHL next season and be one of his team's fastest players.</p>
<p>His puck skills are also of that same extremely high grade. He makes some of the most unique puck plays you'll see, to where it's hard to describe his puck skills other than to say "watch him." His creativity, hand-eye coordination, and balance are simply incredible. McDavid also has elite hockey sense, so on top of his knowing how to make defenders miss left and right and set up his teammates, this also lets him be an elite forechecker when combined with his skating. He follows the play off the puck so well that whenever he's on the ice -- even when the other team has the puck -- you're still expecting a McDavid scoring chance.</p>
<p>He's a relentless worker, and with that quality thrown in with some of his others, it makes him a very dangerous penalty killer as well. McDavid's sole real weakness is his frame right now, as bulking up will be a key for him to survive some of the NHL's physical hurdles.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/hockey_east.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>2. Jack Eichel<br>
C, Boston University (Hockey East)<br>
DOB: 10/28/96 | Ht: 6-2 | Wt: 194<br>
2014-15 GP: 40 | G: 26 | A: 45</b></p>
<p>Eichel is one of the very best college freshmen of the modern era, and had a simply fantastic season. His skill level is elite, and it's off the charts for a 6-2 forward in terms of the amount of high-level plays he makes regularly. Eichel uses a longer than average stick, and with his wingspan and skills he can be almost impossible to get off of the puck. He makes evasions seem effortless to where I often hear from scouts that he looks "bored" on the ice because he exerts so little energy when he makes defensemen miss.</p>
<p>He's strong, works hard and thinks the game at such a high level that he creates chances in bunches. His hockey sense allows him to be a top-end playmaker, but he's also a very good defensive forward, who has often been one of his team's top penalty killers. He skates very well with an explosive first few steps and a smooth glide you don't see often with bigger players. He projects as a potential No. 1 star center.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> The best way to describe the rationale for Eichel over Mitch Marner is that they share similar raw offensive qualities, but Eichel's size and more well-rounded game propel him over the latter. In terms of skating, puck skills and offensive IQ, they are very close. Maybe Marner has a small edge in one or two categories, but in size, Eichel is a 6-2, 200-pound center as opposed to Marner, who is 5-11, 175 pounds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Marner has shown solid defense, Eichel's defensive capabilities are very impressive for his age group. Some may point to Marner's incredible production in the OHL -- one of the best under-18 seasons in recent memory -- but Eichel's production is also of that same ludicrous level, especially when you account for the fact he's a late October birth date, putting him five to eight months behind where most freshmen tend to be physically.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>3. Mitch Marner<br>
C, London (OHL)<br>
DOB: 5/5/97 | Ht: 5-11 | Wt: 163<br>
2014-15 GP: 63 | G: 44 | A: 82</b></p>
<p>Marner had a fantastic 17-year-old season in the OHL, racking up an absurd amount of points. He's a shifty player, and is tough for a defense to stop. His speed, acceleration and edge control are all high-end, and because of that, you rarely saw an OHL defenseman land a clean check on Marner. His puck skills are elite, and he can make great in-tight plays to evade pressure, dekes in full stride to get around a defender or puck plays off the half-boards that create offense in bunches.</p>
<p>Marner is also an incredible passer, making quick reads with the ability to stretch the ice or move it across laterally through traffic with consistency. While small, his defensive game is solid, and improved quite notably over the course of the OHL season to where he became one of London's better penalty killers. He's also quite an effective forechecker, not in terms of physical play, but rather how well he forces plays and is sneaky on takeaways.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Marner and Dylan Strome were both among the very top scorers in the OHL this season, and both had under-18 seasons that were among the very best of the past 10 years in terms of statistical production.</p>
<p>It's a push in terms of pure hockey sense, although they're better in different ways: Marner is a little more creative and a little better in his defensive reads, while Strome's vision is probably a notch higher. Marner's skating is significantly better than Strome's especially in terms of speed, but Strome has a good four inches on Marner. Marner's production was aided by playing on a stacked London team, while Strome played with McDavid -- albeit typically just on the power play.</p>
<p>The skating difference is really what sways me, even with the size discrepancy, given their puck skills are close and Marner has shown he can defend. Skating kills in the NHL, in terms of being able to gain the zone with control of the puck, and Marner is ahead there.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/ohl.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>4. Dylan Strome<br>
C, Erie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 3/7/97 | Ht: 6-3 | Wt: 187<br>
2014-15 GP: 68 | G: 45 | A: 84</b></p>
<p>Strome was one of the very top scorers in the OHL this season, and while many point to the teammate effect with McDavid on the same team, he didn't play with him much at even strength, yet still managed a roughly 1.5 points-per-game pace when McDavid was hurt.</p>
<p>"He's a big center with high-end skill. You're never going to find that anywhere but the top of the draft" said one scout.</p>
<p>Strome is a great stick handler, especially for a 6-3 player, but he's also smart with the puck. He slows the play down very well, operates well in tight spaces and has the offensive instincts to evade pressure at a high level. He's not great defensively yet, although he's fine on the draw and could project to have decent defensive value down the line.</p>
<p>Strome's main weakness is his skating, as he lacks an explosive top gear and is just roughly average in that area overall.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> The ranking of Marner and Strome ahead of Noah Hanifin was <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/nhl-draft/post?id=744" target="new">discussed in depth</a> here.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/hockey_east.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>5. Noah Hanifin<br>
D, Boston College (Hockey East)<br>
DOB: 1/25/97 | Ht: 6-2 | Wt: 205<br>
2014-15 GP: 37 | G: 5 | A: 18</b></p>
<p>Hanifin is an elite all-around defenseman who has a real chance to be in the NHL next season should he choose to leave Boston College. He's a high-end skater who moves incredibly well for a player of his size. His first few steps are explosive, with as much power out of his pivots and crossovers as you'll see in a defenseman, making him very dangerous in transition.</p>
<p>His puck skills and offensive IQ don't blow you away, but he's very good in those areas. Hanifin can make the quick passes, lead a rush in a dynamic way and makes good decisions with the puck.</p>
<p>Defensively, he closes his gaps well, uses his stick effectively and projects as a player who can stop good forwards. Overall, his game is a high-tempo, high-energy style, though he's not the most bruising defender.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Despite the positional differences and the value it gives Mathew Barzal, overall there is a talent drop-off here. Hanifin's accomplishments during the past two years have been extremely impressive, and it's only because of the incredible seasons of the four players ranked ahead of him that he's slotted No. 5.</p>
<p>On pure talent, Barzal is not too far away from Hanifin. They're both elite skaters, Barzal is better with the puck, and both are very smart. However, Hanifin has a major size edge, and is very good defensively. At the end of the day, output wins out. As an under-18 defenseman in Hockey East, Hanifin has been spectacular, and he was impressive as a double underage at the IIHF World Junior Championships. Barzal's talent level is high-end, and I love the upside, but he just doesn't have the same resume, as he was pretty good but not amazing in 2014-15.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/minor/500/whl.png?w=50&h=50&transparent=true"></p>
<p><b>6. Mathew Barzal<br>
C, Seattle (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/26/97 | Ht: 6-0 | Wt: 181<br>
2014-15 GP: 44 | G: 12 | A: 45</b></p>
<p>In prospect circles, Barzal has been a name in discussion for most of this decade as he came up through the Bantam ranks. The former first overall WHL pick is an exciting and well-rounded prospect with significant upside. He's one of the best skaters in this draft class, with an explosive first step, high-end top speed and his edge work that is among the most impressive of his age group.</p>
<p>Barzal's skill level is also pretty good, with his vision and playmaking being standout attributes. He's patient, creative, and shifty with the puck. He succeeds in many different ways, whether it is off the rush with pace, a quick no-look pass from the cycle, or by making a defenseman miss.</p>
<p>He's not an incredibly physical player, but shows great energy and effort on the ice at both ends. He is often one of his team's top scoring-chance creators and penalty killers.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:&nbsp;</b>Both players are highly skilled, right-handed centers with great character. Konecny's impressed me more when they've played on the same ice, but he's been hurt more often, too. Konecny's overall production during his CHL career has been more impressive, but Barzal arguably was more so this season. I leaned Barzal due to the small gap in skill and seeing more upside.</p>

C, Ottawa (OHL)<br>

<p>Konecny's season started a little slow, but his offense picked up as the campaign went along, and the former No. 1 pick in the OHL draft remains a top-end prospect. He's an explosive skater who jets through the neutral zone with the best in the CHL. He darts well in small spaces, and he can turn defensemen's hips with his straight-line speed.</p>
<p>Konecny is small and doesn't win a ton of battles, but he is tough, and he plays a fearless style of hockey where he drives the net and gets involved physically. He's a very skilled puck handler, who can make defenders miss. He's also a very smart offensive player who is more than just a pure dangler. He sees the ice very well and makes a lot of great reads. He also has fine defensive value, and could project onto a pro-level penalty kill if he handles the physical grind.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> The explanation here is similar to Hanifin vs. Barzal, but the degrees are not as severe; thus, Konecny's talent and positional value win out against Zach Werenski. Werenski's offensive capabilities are very impressive, but unlike Hanifin, he's not as dynamic defensively. He's arguably a little better with the puck than Hanifin, and a high-end skater.</p>
<p>These differences matter when pressed against Konecny's great offensive tools. Werenski's NCAA performance was very unique for an under-18 player, almost as good as Hanifin, although he hasn't looked as impressive during international play. The call here is close, but my philosophy is that when the call is close, go with the forward, especially a right-handed center!</p>

<p>Werenski was incredible this season, and was arguably Michigan's best defenseman despite being 17 years old.</p>
<p>"He's smooth as silk" said one scout; with another saying "he makes everything look easy."</p>
<p>His skating won't blow you away, but he's certainly above average, with power out of his first step, good edges and footwork. Werenski is at the top of his game when he has the puck, whether it's on an outlet, bringing it up on the rush or controlling a power play. He makes a ton of plays offensively and never looks panicked when doing so.</p>
<p>He's pretty developed physically already, measuring in at 6-2 and 214 pounds, although he's not a very physical player. His defense isn't poor, in fact I'd say it's better than average, but he can get caught making mistakes in his positional play. He's a potential top-four D-man, who can also be a first-unit power-play option.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> While this may be seem like semantics -- and often outside of a "tier" that's what one-on-one rankings end up being -- the reasons for taking Werenski over Mathew Barzal is a matter of degrees relative to the Konecny vs. Werenski ranking explanation.</p>
<p>The main difference is that while Svechnikov's skill set is of a very high degree, it is just not as high as Konecny's, and thus tilts the scale towards the defenseman Werenski. His skating and vision are around the same level, and his off-the-puck game somewhat better, but his pure skill and offensive creativity are not at the same level of Konecny. Thus, when you consider the merits of Weresnki's game, and his incredible production with Michigan, it tilts the scale in his favor.</p>

<p>Svechnikov has been a top prospect in the Russian program for a number of years, and had an impressive first season in North America. He's a 6-2 forward with a ton of talent who effectively switched to center in the latter months of the season. He's very shifty in tight, and can make lightning-quick moves to evade pressure. Svechnikov also uses his big frame well to protect the puck and doesn't shy away from putting physical pressure on his opponents. He sees the ice well, and has good touch on all his passes.</p>
<p>His skating isn't a standout attribute, but he skates at a solid to average level, which makes him stand out as a bigger player. His defense is a notable "work in progress," and he doesn't at all seem like a player you're projecting into tough defensive roles as an NHLer. His upside is top-end, as you don't often see his combination of size, puck skills and offensive IQ.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> I discussed Lawson Crouse as a prospect <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/nhl-draft/insider/post?id=709" target="_blank">in length here</a> in terms of what gets him into this range of players. In terms of the particularities of Crouse vs. Svechnikov, Crouse is a better skater. He's not worlds better, but the manner in which Crouse moves is more impressive than Svechnikov, especially in terms of straight-line speed. Crouse is elite in terms of his physical play and defense, as opposed to Svechnikov being just good in the former and sub-par in the latter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Svechnikov is much better in terms of puck skills, offensive IQ and vision. I lean Svechnikov because with wide differences in offensive play for one and defensive play with the other, the offensive skill is more enticing in projecting a player, especially at the forward position.</p>

<p>Crouse is a player with fantastic physical gifts, and despite a lack of amazing statistical production, he's consistently impressive. He's an outstanding skater for a 6-4 forward and will be an above-average skater at the NHL level. Given his large body mass, the way he gets up to his top gear so quickly is a standout attribute of his game.</p>
<p>Crouse plays a tough brand of hockey, supplemented by his filled-out frame, and he projects as an elite physical player in the NHL. Crouse is very advanced defensively for an under-18 prospect, showing very good defensive awareness and penalty-killing skills. He's not a standout offensively, but he's above average in terms of puck skills and offensive ability; he just doesn't show it consistently. I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of offensive IQ, or not yet being comfortable playing that kind of game. But, I've seen him make high-level plays, the points will come.</p><p></p>

<p>Zacha's season was a little up and down, as he lost time due to injuries and performed pretty well, but was somewhat below expectations considering he's been a highly touted prospect for the past few years. All the tools point in the right direction for Zacha. He's a big, strong forward who uses his body well to win battles and deliver hits. He's a fantastic skater for a big man. His technique is very refined, he's good in tight spaces, and can explode through the neutral zone.</p>
<p>He's also a pretty skilled playmaker who shows skilled, coordinated puck handling and the vision to make plays. Zacha's shot is notably above average, with a ton of torque behind it. He'll need to improve his defensive positioning, but he does show effort to come back on D.</p>

<p>Rantanen had as good a second half as any prospect in this year's class, with a great World Juniors, and carried one of <a href="https://twitter.com/coreypronman/status/568166368262164480" target="new">the worst teams</a> in the Liiga this season despite being under 19. Rantanen is a big-bodied, 6-foot-4 forward with tremendous skill for a player his size. His hands are above average to high end, with the offensive creativity to make tough plays. Rantanen is a good playmaker who can make some impressive passes and flash top-end ability in that area.</p>
<p>He's not an overly physical player, but on occasion he'll drive the net and make the most of his size; unfortunately, that doesn't happen as much as you'd hope. His skating is roughly average, maybe a tick below out of the gate, although I've heard some Finnish scouts say they're not too concerned there. Rantanen's defense showed improvements this season, but that area could also use some work.</p>

<p>Connor has had multiple All-Star-caliber seasons in the USHL, and is the top prospect to come out of that league this season. He plays the game with energy and pace, and is a fantastic skater with a little giddy-up in his step. He comes barreling down the wing, and puts pressure on defensemen with his speed. His hockey IQ and his skating allow him to be an effective defensive forward as well.</p>
<p>He's not especially great as a dangler, but he's definitely above average in the puck skills category, with very quick hands. He likes getting to the net, and is the kind of player to get the puck on the sideboards, make a move to make a defender miss, and either drive the puck to the crease or get a shot on goal.</p>

<p>Provorov is a very skilled and advanced defenseman who has shown a strong commitment to North America, having played on this side of the Atlantic for the past four seasons. He's a very gifted skater with good agility and power out of his stride. Mechanically, he isn't perfect -- he has an awkward lean-over skating style -- but the end result looks promising, with room to improve. He's above average as an offensive player, with good puck skills and great ability to find lanes and move the puck.</p>
<p>He's slightly undersized for a defenseman, but he's decent-to-solid in his own end, with good angles, positioning and stick work. There are times when his defensive zone play shows a read error, but overall, he makes enough stops to be reliable at even strength.</p>

<p>Kylington's season was a little bumpy due to reassignments and injury, but overall, it was very impressive considering the high level at which he played in tough, pro leagues. He's a brilliant skater who gains speed easily, and has the four-way movements to stay with quick forwards. Kylington is a very skilled puck handler, who makes a lot of creative plays and controls the puck in tight spaces as well as the best forwards in this class. He stretches the ice well, and can control a power play very effectively. His offensive IQ and vision are high-end, and his total package offensively can create chances out of nowhere and control the game.</p>
<p>He has his warts, however, as he isn't the best in the physical aspects of the game in terms of effort or his frame, and his shot could be better. His defense isn't perfect, but it isn't bad. If anything I'd project him to be about average defensively, while being a top-end offensive defenseman.</p>

<p>Bracco is an exciting -- albeit very small -- winger who can take over a game. He's a high-end skater with great agility, acceleration and ability to push the pace on exits and entries. When you combine his skating with his very high skill level, he's a nightmare for defenders to check. He's very coordinated, and draws your attention with the way he creates offense out of nothing. Scouts refer to him as an "assist machine" due to his talent level and his very creative playmaking style.</p>
<p>Bracco is quite solid defensively, and in my viewings has been effective killing penalties and as a short-handed scoring threat. His 5-foot-9 frame is an obvious drawback, especially since he's not an overly abrasive type of player.</p>

<p>I can't say how tough it was for me to put Sprong this "low," even though I suspect he'll go lower on draft day. A part of me wanted to get him into my top 10. Sprong put up a lot of points this season, and while he wasn't among the very top scorers in the QMJHL, he is one of the most dynamic players in the league. Whichever team drafts him, Sprong will become a favorite of that fan base because he's so fun to watch. He's an explosive skater who can push the tempo very well and has smooth mechanics to generate a lot of power from each stride.</p>
<p>He has a high skill level with the puck, making a lot of difficult plays and displaying good coordination. He sees the ice well and regularly sets up chances for his teammates. He also has a very good shot, generating a lot of torque through his windups. Sprong needs to bulk up, work on his defense a bit, and gain more consistency in his play. His upside is fantastic, though, and if he ends up as one of the best players from this class, I would not be at all surprised.</p>

<p>Merkley had a very impressive season as one of the WHL's top scorers. He's a high-end offensive weapon who can make a wide variety of plays to generate scoring chances, and is a dynamic puck handler with very soft hands and a high level of creativity. Merkley makes plays in tight spaces and at a very quick pace. He's a very flashy player -- arguably at times trying to be too fancy -- but overall the tempo at which he plays makes him very dangerous.</p>
<p>In games I've seen, he's looked like just an above-average skater, but several scouts I talk to describe him as great in that area. His 5-foot-11 frame isn't ideal, but he works hard in puck battles, has a fine strength level and seems to have the character components to overcome his size. His defensive play has also shown immense improvements from 12 months ago.</p>

<p>Roy has been a top prospect for years, and has consistently displayed his very impressive offensive upside. He's also the rare right-handed defenseman who plays the left side with higher frequency. He's a very good skater in all directions, with nice edge work and a quality top gear. His puck skills are clearly above average, and he's a coordinated puck handler who can lead a rush with ease.</p>
<p>His puck movement is high-end, as he thinks quickly, is creative and doesn't force plays. Roy is slightly undersized and could tighten his gaps defensively at times, but he makes some defensive stops and battles well.</p>

<p>Cernak has also been a very impressive prospect for some time, being one of Slovakia's top under-18 products of the past 10-15 years. He has a ton of high-level experience, including a great season in Slovakia's top league and playing for the national squad. His tool kit is extremely appealing, and he has a raw upside that's sky high: He projects to skate and handle the puck at above-average NHL levels.</p>
<p>Cernak is also a physical defender who can make defensive stops as well as play a part on a team's power play. His main issue is his hockey IQ, as he shows a moderate frequency to make bad decisions on hits, pinches and puck decisions. At the top of his game, he can look like a dominant two-way defenseman, but that is not always the guy who shows up.</p><p></p>

<p>A former top pick in the QMJHL draft, Shawnigan had a very good second season in the league, finishing among the top under-18 scorers in all of the CHL. Beauvillier's main weakness is his size, as he measured in at 5-10, but other than that, he's a pretty well-rounded prospect. He's a decent defensive center who is good on draws and displays a high-end work ethic at both ends of the rink. Beauvillier plays with energy, drives the net and engages physically.</p>
<p>He's an above-average skater, who can gain the zone effectively by pushing the defenders back on their gaps. He's not an overly flashy player -- and I've never seen him dominate a game -- but he's always making plays. He's certainly got puck skills, but his best trait is his hockey IQ. He sees the play unfolding very well and sets up chances with his patience and vision. He also has a pretty good shot.</p>

<p>After coming in to his draft season as a top-15 prospect, White's season didn't unfold quite as well as he'd have liked because of several ailments, but he still managed to pull off a fine campaign. White's standout attribute is his hockey sense.</p>
<p>"He has so many little details to his game" said one scout, "he makes smart plays all over the ice."</p>
<p>White is a smooth, quiet player that gets a lot done. He sees the ice at a high level, he's creative, but isn't overly flashy with the puck, and rarely makes mistakes. White is very good defensively, often being the kind of player who is leaned on to kill penalties and take critical defensive zone draws. His skating is what one scout describes as "deceptively quick," in that he won't jet down the wing, but he can get to a good top gear and doesn't labor around the ice.</p>

<p>Stephens isn't the tallest guy, but he was a top player for Saginaw this season and played well at the Ivan Hlinka tournament and under-18 world championships. He really turned his season around in the past few months of the season. Speed and pace define Stephens' game, as he's a fantastic skater whose speed is high-end. Stephens' stride generates so much power, he looks like he's gliding over the ice at times.</p>
<p>He has great work ethic on the ice, battling through checks well, getting to the net, and coming back on defense with tenacity.

He has the pure skill level to score, as well as the grit and frame to kill penalties effectively.</p>

<p>Vande Sompel had a very interesting season. For the most part, he was Oshawa's top defenseman, but when needed, he actually shifted to be the team's top line <em>center</em>. That's unique versatility, as he played forward all season on the penalty kill, so as they say in baseball, NHL teams might be able to "move him off the position" if teams are worried about his 5-10 frame on defense.</p>
<p>He's a great skater, with quick, active feet and the speed to gain the zone with ease. He shows the comfort leading the play and attacking, as one would imagine for a player who grew up a forward. He's skilled (though not amazingly so) with the puck. However, Vande Sompel is at a very high level in terms of his hockey IQ. He's quite advanced defensively given his development track and quite effective positionally for a smaller player. His upside is tantalizing.</p>

Meier has a pro-sized frame, skates and handles the puck at above-average levels and can play with pace.</p>
<p>His ability to play either a speed, skill or power game makes him very appealing, especially since he shows a commitment to get back into the defensive zone.

<p>Andersson has been one of the hardest prospects to pin down this season. If you told me two years ago Andersson would not be in my top 15, I'd have called you crazy. But there are enough red flags in his game to warrant some skepticism.</p>
<p>He's a dynamic offensive talent with great puck skills, especially for a player with a pro-sized frame. He has an aggressive, attacking style of play and loves to have the puck on his stick. In terms of power-play skills, his combination of IQ, skill and a big shot makes him one of the top offensive defensemen in the class. The red flags are his lackluster defensive play in terms of his off-puck reads, up-and-down effort levels, being too aggressive offensively and his habit of getting beat with speed at times.</p>

<p>Aho had a fine season, including lengthy stints in Finland's top league, playing in the top nine for Finland at the WJC and excelling during under-18 tournaments. He skates pretty well, and while he doesn't have blazing speed, it's certainly above average and enough to pressure defensemen off the rush. He's a very skilled and smart offensive player who won't make overly flashy plays but makes quick, creative decisions and moves the puck very well. His vision is high-end and can be a real threat on the power play.</p>
<p>Aho's hockey IQ translates well to defense, where he's shown during international play he can be quite effective, even when playing ahead of his age group. The main issue with Aho is his physical game. He's 5-11, 170 pounds and doesn't engage as much or as well as you'd hope someone would with his frame.</p>

<p>DeBrusk had an excellent age-17 season, showing off his many tools. He's a good skater, generates a dangerous top gear and has solid power in his lower body. His work ethic is strong, and that helps him cover a lot of ice. DeBrusk is a very skilled playmaker who can make the soft-touch plays to his teammates, as well as create chances for himself.</p>
<p>He's a little undersized, but he fights through checks, gets back on defense and is a solid penalty killer. In the WHL this season, he showed he can be an all-situations player while also making an occasional appearance on highlight reels.</p>

<p>Kase had a very interesting season, playing all year in the Czech second division, and while he didn't put up great numbers considering the quality of that league, he was impressive in international play. Other than his size and physical game, Kase's game is positive in almost every other aspect.</p>
<p>He's a quick, shifty skater who can lead a rush and is elusive in tight spaces. He's a great playmaker, who can dictate the play on the man advantage with his skill and vision. He also shows the willingness and hockey IQ to be an effective defensive player; as he gains strength, that aspect of his game should improve even more. He hasn't really produced gaudy numbers, but on a scouting level, I think he's looked fantastic at times and has the ability to be a potential home run for the team that lands him.</p><p></p>

<p>Boeser had a very good first full USHL season and was one of the league's leading goal-scorers as an under-18 player. He's a good physical player, with a bulky 6-foot-1 frame and a great work ethic. Boeser is strong on the puck in battles to help maintain possession, and he goes to the net with consistency. He has one of the better shots in this draft class and gets it off quickly with zip.</p>
<p>While he's skilled, he's not an overly flashy player; he's more of a read-and-react player, who also has solid hand-eye coordination. His skating is about average and leans to being a little below that mark; it's not a huge liability, but he could gain an extra step. His defense also could use some work.</p>

<p>Hintz took significant steps forward this season, as he became a top-nine player in Finland's top league and also played in the country's top six during the WJC. Hintz has a lot of appealing physical traits. He is 6-foot-3, skates at an above-average level and gets through the neutral zone very well for a bigger player. He's a skilled puck handler who displays impressive coordination with the puck for a player his size and can create chances by making his checks miss.</p>
<p>His all-around game could use some fine-tuning, however. Although he's big, he's not an overly physical player. He also still needs a fair bit of work defensively, in terms of reads and effort.</p>

<p>Malgin has been a top prospect in Switzerland's program for a number of years, having already played more than 20 international games and two full seasons of pro hockey. He's a pretty good skater, and though not a tremendous blazer, he is very shifty with great edge work and an above-average top gear. His puck skills are fantastic, as Malgin can make offense out of nothing with his creative hockey mind and threaten off the rush.</p>
<p>He's a very good passer who can make a lot of tough dishes but can also try to be too fancy at times. Generally, he's a very dangerous offensive player with a lot of upside. He's small, and his fringe physical game restricts him, especially since he's not great defensively. He plays center currently, but I could see him pushed off to the wing as a North American pro.</p>

<p>Novak had a pretty good rookie USHL season, in which he hovered around the point-per-game mark, and there were many games in which he was dominant and just didn't capitalize. He was the leading scorer at the Ivan Hlinka tournament and was second in scoring at the Junior-A challenge. Novak has a very high skill level. He's very coordinated and creative with the puck, and he makes a lot of high-difficulty plays and creates scoring chances in bunches.</p>
<p>He's a quick, elusive skater with good jump in his step, though one NHL scouted noted that his short legs keep him from exploding through the neutral zone. He needs to bulk up and work on his defense a fair amount, but he is a player with great offensive touch and has high upside.</p>

<p>Guryanov had a pretty good season -- scoring around a point per game in the Russian junior league and getting a stint in the KHL, on top of good international performances. He is an explosive skater and gets the highest of grades in terms of pure skating ability for a player his size. He pushes the pace very well and can be a lot to handle for defenders on the rush. He combines that with a pretty impressive skill level, as he creates a lot of chances with his hands and vision.</p>
<p>His decisions with the puck aren't always great, but he does get involved a lot on offense. Guryanov is also a solid finisher, flashing an above-average shot. Guryanov gets pretty involved in the physical play and at times might even push the limits in that regard, in terms of penalty trouble. He's not a defensive stalwart, but he's solid in his own end -- closing on his checks effectively -- and has penalty-killing skills on top of being a shorthanded scoring threat.</p>

<p>Spacek had a pretty impressive season for an under-18 forward in the Czech Republic's top league, as he put up 12 points in 40 games playing against men. He's a flashy and exciting offensive player who regularly shows the ability to make high-difficulty plays. Spacek sees the ice at a very high level, which makes him dangerous when he sets up with space, as he frequently finds his linemates for scoring chances.</p>
<p>He's an agile skater who can be quite elusive and make defenders miss. He's not a blazer in terms of his top gear, but he's above-average there. Spacek plays the game with energy and good work ethic, but overall, his physical game is less than impressive, and he doesn't look all that imposing when he engages in puck battles. His defensive positioning could use work, with his frame not helping him in that regard.</p>

<p>Carlo had a fine second season in the WHL and was on USA's under-20 team in a decent role as well. Carlo is a big defenseman who plays a tough brand of hockey and can defend at even strength and on the PK quite well, using his size to get in lanes and clear the net. He has solid enough hockey sense and can anticipate some of the faster plays, and he knows how to transition the puck.</p>
<p>His skating isn't fantastic, as his stride can be a little short, but overall, he moves well for a big guy and has the puck skills to get up into the attack. He could curtail some of the mistakes he makes, especially on forcing offensive plays, and continue to fill out his massive frame. He projects as a defensive defenseman with a small chance at bringing offense too. I've also seen him play his off-wing side somewhat effectively.</p>

<p>The Czech native was very good in his rookie Q season after crossing the pond. He played all situations for the Sea Dogs and got better as the season went along. Zboril has a pretty well-rounded style but doesn't have one particular elite skill.</p>
<p>"He's a great skater who carries the puck well," one NHL scout said, while another stated, "He's got a great physical game and can make plays in his own end."</p>
<p>His footwork is very clean, with an easy stride and the power to get up in the rush. Zboril doesn't have standout puck skills, but he's a very calm and efficient passer who makes plays when under pressure. He uses his frame well to win battles and box out forwards and still has room to fill out. Defensively, he shows solid value. His positioning and reads aren't perfectly tweaked yet, as I've seen him get beat a little too much, but he makes stops and can kill penalties at a fine level.</p>

<p>Like Zboril, Dergachev's play picked up as the season went along, which ended with his making a bit of a surprise appearance in Russia's top nine at the WJC. He's a two-way center with size, and this makes him a very appealing prospect. He's not going to dominate a power play, but his skill level is above average, with good hand-eye coordination for a player of his size.</p>
<p>His offensive IQ is solid. He'll set up chances for his linemates and understands his position well. Dergachev is pretty good on defense and can handle tough assignments. He uses his big frame well to protect the puck, win battles and drive the net. He also fills lanes well on the penalty kill. His skating isn't great overall, and I'd peg his speed at about average.</p>

<p>Forsbacka-Karlsson, or JFK, as I call him (think that nickname will stick?), has been on the prospect radar for many years, and though I don't think I've ever seen him flat-out dominate a game, he almost always shows a very reliable all-around performance.</p>
<p>He's one of the best defensive forwards available in this year's class. He is great at faceoffs, gets in lanes pretty well and exhibits great work ethic. He will at times show the offensive ability to be a real creator, but that is not a very consistent element of his game, and he projects more as a tough-minutes, middle-six type of player. He does have fine skating and skill but probably lacks the offensive instinct and creativity to be a difference-maker at the pro level.</p>
<p>"The offensive upside is the biggest question with him: Can he score as a pro?" one NHL head scout wondered.</p><p></p>

<p>At one point, Roy was thought to be a sure-fire elite NHL prospect, and while he hasn't had that kind of season, he still remains a desirable player with a lot of ability. Six-foot-four forwards with great skill don't grow on trees (I checked,) and that's especially true of ones like Roy who are committed to playing a 200-foot game. He makes unique plays because of his giant frame and how he can maintain puck possession. His hockey sense is very high in terms of how he sees the ice, anticipates how to create chances and reads defensive cues.</p>
<p>Roy is a decent skater, fine for his size, but has a bit of a low-energy style in which he isn't fully exerting his stride; his first few steps could also use work. He'll win battles, but he should win more for a player with his frame. He's a high-risk, high-reward prospect.</p>

<p>The "other" Sebastian Aho is a very talented player with high-end skating and hockey sense. His ability to process the game at such a high level with his creativity and two-way reads makes him an impact player -- at times. He's a skilled puck handler who moves the puck well and can make defensive stops. His defensive play isn't perfect, but he has shown ability in his own end and on the penalty kill despite his size.</p>
<p>One of the biggest surprises of the 2014 draft was watching every eligible defenseman on Sweden's under-18 team get drafted -- except for their best one in Aho. I get the argument against him: He's 5-9. Sure, it's a problem, but it's not a problem that should make one ignore everything else about his game. There's no guarantee Aho will play at a high level as a North American pro, but I think he's done more than enough to prove he's a real prospect -- he deserves a shot.</p>

<p>I'm lower on Bittner than the industry, but it's hard to ignore that he has some appealing characteristics. He's 6-4, but skates like he's 5-11. His skating mechanics are very smooth, and he can be a handful on the rush due to his speed and frame. Bittner isn't a pure dangler, but he doesn't have rock hands, either. His shot is arguably high end, as it comes off the tape with scorching velocity and he can locate it well.</p>
<p>His hockey sense is bit of a question mark, in that he makes some odd decisions, but he shows good vision and creates scoring chances. Bittner's defensive play could also use some tweaks, but he shows effort and average reads. He could be a scoring power forward in the NHL if his development goes well.</p>

<p>Eriksson played a good chunk of this season in the SHL, and also played very well in the top Swedish junior circuit. He's a very versatile player and is a low-risk type of prospect. Eriksson's hockey IQ is his best trait.</p>
<p>"He's so smart, always in the right place and never makes a mistake with the puck," said one scout.</p>
<p>I wouldn't classify him as a dominant player, but whether he's playing in front of the net on the power play, creating from the side boards, killing off penalties, checking good players, taking a key draw, or being the extra man when the team needs a goal, coaches always can rely on Eriksson. His puck skills are solid, and his skating is about average, with his straight-line speed being stronger than his edges and bursts.</p>

<p>Chabot had a very quality second campaign in the Q, especially when Saint John's defensive depth was tested and he was asked to step into a bigger role. He's a very gifted skater who can outlet the puck well and is very dangerous off the rush. Chabot has impressive overall hockey IQ, especially offensively, as he sees the ice very well and is able to control the tempo.</p>
<p>His value is certainly offensively tilted, as he loves to join the attack and stretch the ice with his passes. But, he's not entirely one-dimensional, as he can make some defensive stops, is physical and can be effective on the penalty kill. He'll need to continue to develop his defensive play, but he could be a two-way defenseman as a pro.</p>

Chlapik is a skilled playmaker who displays very good hockey sense. His hand-eye coordination and stick skills are impressive, but he's more at home when he gets time to be patient and find ways to make plays.</p>
<p>His frame is pretty sturdy, and he shows a good power game in terms of puck protection and battling in the tough spaces. I've heard some scouts praise his defensive game, and while it's certainly fine, I don't give him as high a grade there yet. His skating is a hole right now. His speed is roughly average and his stride is a little awkward in terms of his push-offs.</p>

<p>Siegenthaler has already played two full seasons of pro hockey in Switzerland before his 18th birthday between their A and B division, on top of a ton of international hockey. He's very physically mature already -- at 6-3, 220 pounds -- and has shown he can handle physicality playing against men and projects to be potentially high-end in that area in North America.</p>
<p>Siegenthaler is a great skater for a player his size, showing good four-way mobility and an ability to get into the attack. He moves the puck well, displaying decent to solid offensive skill with fine vision on outlets and on the power play. Siegenthaler is solid defensively due to his feet and physical play. His reads in both ends could use some work, as he can get caught with his gaps not being controlled well or coughing up the puck too often. His hockey sense is not a huge issue, but it's not great either.</p>

<p>However, Meloche is a very aggressive physical player who delivers punishing hits. He can kill penalties, though he could fix a read or two in his positioning; but, he makes defensive plays. Meloche is a solid puck mover and he gets a ton of shots through to goal due to his shooting skills and his hockey IQ. He projects as an all-situations defenseman.</p>

<p>His skating is above average and arguably plus. He's also quite skilled with the puck, but what stands out is his hockey IQ. He's a creative offensive player in terms of one-on-one moves and creating for his linemates. He's not a fantastic defensive player but has value in his own end. If he isn't 5-9, I think you're talking about a very well-rounded player (and one who'd be drafted higher); instead, one has to wonder how much his size issues will limit him. I think he's answered a lot of those questions this season in a positive way.</p>

<p>The nephew of 14-season NHL vet Rich Pilon, Ryan was one of the top offensive defensemen in the WHL and a key part of one of the top teams in that league. He's a skilled puck mover who can be dangerous off the rush and is very effective on the power play. He's very calm and creative with the puck and is often the starting point of offense.</p>
<p>He's not a blazer, but is an above-average skater with a good first step. He works hard in one-on-one battles and wins a lot of them due to his effort and size. He could use some tweaking in his defensive play, specifically in terms of gap control. Pilon also has a tendency to cough up the puck at inopportune times.</p><p></p>

<p>Looke trended up this season, establishing himself as a regular at even strength for Brynas, and made Sweden's WJC team. He's a highly skilled playmaker, with true high-end puck skills. He is a very shifty player, who makes the game at a quick tempo and can make great in-tight plays. He's a fine skater, and is technically sound with above-average speed. Looke is average off the puck, but he can make some plays in that area and win some battles despite not being overly physical. His reads aren't always perfect, as he can force some decisions.</p>

<p>Pilipenko didn't really get much exposure in major events this season, so truth be told, this ranking is more based on his extremely impressive 17-year-old season. He's got one of the bigger upsides out of the players who will go outside the top 45-60 picks. Pilipenko's offensive skill is high-end, with the creativity and offensive IQ to make unique plays and create scoring chances. His skating is good, not great, and he's not too explosive for a smaller forward. His vision is solid, but he'll make his money by making players miss and being a finisher with the puck. Pilipenko's all-around game also needs some fine-tuning; his physical game isn't too impressive and his defensive game needs significant work.</p>

<p>The Columbus, Ohio, native impressed me every time I saw the USNTDP play, and was productive all season. He's a very good skater, and though he isn't as high-end with his puck skills, that area is still pretty good. He's also a smart two-way player. Roslovic sees the ice well, with the ability to make the difficult distributions. He also has some dazzle to his game, and will on occasion execute a rush that draws the attention of the crowd. He could stand to bulk up, as he's not all that intimidating in the physical game. Consistency of effort is also a flaw in the view of some scouts.</p>

<p>The former sixth overall pick in his WHL bantam draft is a very good skater, and has one of the best size/speed ratios in the class. He plays the game with intensity, and has physical abilities that can make him a force. Gropp is strong on the puck, and can flash a top-end wrist shot as well. I'm not sold on his hockey IQ as of now. He can kill penalties well, but that's less due to his anticipation and more about his frame, speed and intangibles. His decisions and pace just overall don't look too impressive at the moment, and he's more of a player who goes out and gives it his all without playing within too much structure.</p>

<p>Larsson is a very interesting prospect who played at the top level at times for Frolunda this season, and was a top-four defenseman in Sweden's under-18 lineup. He's got a lot of physical tools, moves effortlessly in all directions and evades pressure pretty well for a big guy. He's not an overly gifted puck mover, but has solid to above-average skill. Defensively, Larsson can make some stops. He uses his body well to win battles and shows good effort in battles. He's not great in his own end, as he could clean up his reads, reactions and overall positioning. His skating allows him to make up for some errors.</p>

<p>Fischer was pretty effective this season playing in the upper half of the USNTDP lineup. He's got size and skill, and immediately draws eyes when he's on the ice. He doesn't have elite puck skills, but he's pretty coordinated and creative, maintains possession well and makes tough plays. His offensive IQ is a very impressive trait. I've seen flashes of above-average skating, but he's not that explosive out of the gate. Fischer can be very effective when he drives the net and uses his body, but his physical game is somewhat inconsistent. His defensive play ticked up as the season went along, but that probably won't be his calling card as a pro.</p>

<p>Saarela came into the season as a top-30 prospect after impressing in his 15- and 16-year-old seasons. However, while he played well generally, he underwhelmed at times, hence the drop. He's a very skilled puck handler and playmaker, and can evade pressure effectively due to his skill and lower-body strength. He's a very smart player in traffic, who makes the in-tight plays and has a scorer's instinct. His off-puck game needs work, as his defense and physical effort aren't the best.</p>

<p>I was really high on Wotherspoon coming into the season, thinking he may have had the potential to even go in the first round. He didn't have that strong of a showing in 2014-15, but there's still a lot to like with him. Wotherspoon is a good skater; his edges are great, and he can be very tough to get a handle on by forecheckers. He is creative, and sees plays developing well offensively. He's about average in the defensive end, as he shows some impressive reads but gets beat a little too often. Wotherspoon will get involved physically, but his frame betrays him in one-on-one battles. He's probably going to be more effective with his stick checks than physical play as a pro.</p>

<p>A former fourth overall pick in his QMJHL draft, Carrier is a pretty talented prospect, though as you'd expect for someone at No. 59 overall here, he is not without flaws. Carrier is skilled puck mover with great overall hockey sense. He controls a power play quite effectively, and makes quick decisions. He's small for a defenseman, but still makes defensive plays in terms of his stick positioning and overall anticipation. His skating isn't too strong, and combined with his size, doesn't help his defensive projection going forward, as the size and ability of his opponents will improve drastically.</p>

<p>Kovacs led Sweden's second-division circuit in goals and points by an under-20 player, and was also the leading scorer on his pro team. He plays a fast-tempo type of game with his above-average to high-end speed, and great work ethic. He shows a tendency to play the body and plays the game with an edge. At times, he could stand to slow the game down or show better creativity and decision-making, but to his credit, he's made it work so far in pro hockey playing an aggressive, north-south type of game.</p><p></p>

<p>Korostelev is a Russian-born prospect who came up the amateur ranks in Ontario, and has had two straight solid campaigns in the OHL. He's a pretty good physical forward with a filled-out frame, and he displays a strong power game with the puck. Korostelev can play a perimeter game as well as the inside game due to his impressive hands and vision. He also has a high-end shot, as his one-timers generate a ton of velocity. His skating is a bit of a knock, as he lacks a separation gear coming down the wing.</p>

<p>An Oregon native, Yan had a pretty strong first QMJHL season, and was a top scorer for Shawinigan. He also had a strong Ivan Hlinka tourney performance. It's all about upside with Yan, as he's big, with a ton of offensive ability. He looks like a first-round player when he has the puck, as he's very creative, shifty, patient, good in tight spaces and sees the ice well. Yan's hands allow him to put away chances around the net well, and he also features an above-average wrist shot. His physical game, skating and off-puck reads could use some work.</p>

<p>Garland's development ticked up quite a few notches this season after he went undrafted last year, as he led the QMJHL in scoring and was named the league's MVP. He's an electric offensive talent who makes some really unique plays with the puck; he's perhaps the class's best dangler. Overall, he understands all the different ways he can create offense, and processes that information quickly. He's not a blazing speedster, but he's shifty, with a good burst and edge control. His size is the obvious flaw, and likely why he was passed over last year.</p>

He's a towering player, and has a good physical game. His first few skating strides aren't the prettiest, but he gets where he needs to go and has the speed to push defensemen back. He creates by driving the tough areas, making players miss and has set-up skills, too. His hockey IQ isn't great, as he can force plays and get behind the pace at times.</p>

Knott has great physical tools, with above-average skating abilities. He's a pretty advanced defensive player, and is a solid penalty killer. Knott has decent puck skills and IQ, but I wouldn't characterize him as an overly skilled or creative player. He's at his best when he's skating hard, going to the front of the net, and making simple plays.</p>

His decisions aren't great, but his creativity is impressive. I've seen flashes of good defensive play from Noel, but it's an area he'll have to continue to improve on even if it showed upward ticks in the second half. His main weakness is his physicality, as he's slightly undersized, needs a lot of bulk and plays a perimeter game.</p>

DOB: 8/28/97 | Ht: 6-1 | Wt: 172<br>
2014-15 GP: 27 | G: 0 | A: 2</strong></p>
<p>The merits of Jasek's abilities are better seen on a scouting level than by his misleading production this season, as he didn't play a ton while on a team in the top Czech division. A very good skater, he has a quick first few steps and consistently shows the ability to push defensemen back on his zone entries. He's not the best in terms of physical play, but he darts around the rink with good energy. His off-puck work needs improvement, but there are enough raw tools here to make him a very intriguing prospect.</p>

DOB: 4/2/97 | Ht: 6-1 | Wt: 181<br>
2014-15 GP: 68 | G: 9 | A: 43</strong></p>
<p>Juulsen was one of the top CHL defenseman scorers this season, and he rose up my board as the campaign went along. He has above-average mobility and puck-moving skills, which is why he was a mainstay for Everett all season on the power play. Juulsen plays a good physical game, which should get better as he puts on more bulk. However, he can be overly aggressive at times, and leave his ideal defensive position. Overall, his defensive-zone play is about average, and he projects more as an offensively tilted player.</p>

2014-15 GP: 58 | G: 18 | A: 49</strong></p>
<p>In his first full season in North America, the Chelyabinsk, Russia, native ended up with around a point per game. He's a North American type of prospect, with a very developed frame for a player his age. Trenin is tough on the puck, maintaining possession well in battles, and shows ability in the defensive zone and on the PK. He's more of a pass-first type of player, but has a solid shot when he gets his opportunities. His skating remains rough, and while I've heard some scouts say they don't mind it, I see a lot of room for improvement in that area.</p>

2014-15 GP: 68 | G: 18 | A: 38</strong></p>
<p>Dunn was one of the top scoring defensemen in the OHL this season on a very inconsistent Niagara team. His skating is clearly high-end, and there are very few defensemen who are better at leading a rush. His great skating allows him to make up for defensive miscues, as I've seen him catch guys like Connor McDavid when they had a step on him. He's great on the power play given his creativity and puck skills. The drawback? His defensive play is certainly a work in progress.</p>

DOB: 7/5/97 | Ht: 6-0 | Wt: 187<br>
2014-15 GP: 16 | G: 0 | A: 1</strong></p>
<p>Carlsson showed good tools during international competition, and while he played 16 games in Sweden's highest league, he averaged less than five minutes per game while doing so. He doesn't stand out at either end of the rink, but he's a solid two-way player. Offensively, he displays solid-to-average stick skills, with fine mobility and straight-line speed. On defense, he makes some stops, wins battles, and was able to kill penalties at the under-18 level. Carlsson gets beat a little too much by speed, and his overall decision-making could use some tweaking.</p><p></p>

2014-15 GP: 66 | G: 15 | A: 24</strong></p>
<p>Unlike his brother (Oilers prospect David), Adam Musil has represented Canada in international play instead of the Czech Republic. A sturdy, two-way center, Musil is tough to get off the puck, and is adept at forechecking and in the D-zone. He likely won't blaze past NHL defensemen, but his skating has shown improvements in the past 12 months. He projects as a middle-six player in the NHL. For those interested in familial connections, his uncle is 18-year NHL vet Bobby Holik.</p>

2014-15 GP: 68 | G: 37 | A: 41</strong></p>
<p>Salituro has had a very successful OHL career, and was his team's leading scorer in 2014-15. He's undersized, but is very gifted with the puck. He increased the tempo of his play a lot this season, making quick passes and decisions to disrupt defenses. His skating isn't great for a smaller guy, but he moves at an above-average level in full flight. This remains an area for improvement.</p>

<p>Foley jumped out when I scouted him at the All-American Prospects Game in September, and continued his solid performance all season in his first USHL campaign. Despite an average frame, he's very strong on the puck and drives the net effectively. His hand-eye coordination is impressive, and he can make some difficult skill plays. Foley must improve his pace and decision-making. He's committed to Providence in 2015-16.</p>

<p>Impressive as a rookie for his hometown Blazers, Sideroff capped off his campaign with a very solid IIHF World U18 Championship, with four points in seven games. He's undersized but contributes in a lot of areas. Sideroff is a few inches shorter than the average pro, but he has an edge to his game and will fight for pucks. He also exhibits fine two-way hockey IQ. A player on the rise.</p>

<p>Rykov is a very toolsy prospect who has drawn attention in international play this season. He moves pretty easily in all directions for a player of his size, with a polished stride and above-average speed. Oddly, he doesn't have a good physical game, often opting to stick check and not engage. On the other hand, he rarely takes a penalty. He has shown an ability to play on both special teams.</p>

2014-15 GP: 69 | G: 13 | A: 25</strong></p>
<p>Bear played his way onto Canada's under-18 team with an impressive summer camp, and played in all manpower situations for Seattle this season. He's a well-rounded prospect but doesn't have standout attributes. I've seen him get burned at times to the outside, but overall he's able to stay with his checks and is solid on defense. Offensively, he's not a great skill player, but he can make some plays and has good offensive IQ.</p>

<p>Nattinen played pro hockey all season, bouncing between the top Finnish division and the second-tier league while also being very impressive in international play. He's a big, skilled, two-way center and a very smart playmaker. His frame is developed for a player his age, and while he's not a real mean physical player, he can be strong on the puck. His main liability is his skating, which is notably below-average at this point.</p>

2014-15 GP: 66 | G: 26 | A: 19</strong></p>
<p>Here's another guy who trended up in a significant way this season. He's one of the quickest players in this draft class, with an elite top gear and an ability to push defensemen off their gaps. He's solid defensively, including on the penalty kill. Some believe he plays a little too much of a North-South game, but still makes offensive plays. Senyshyn plays with energy, but his physical game is subpar as of now.</p>

2014-15 GP: 72 | G: 15 | A: 39</strong></p>
<p>Gawdin is a solid two-way center and the No. 5 overall pick in his WHL bantam draft. He's a solid-to-above-average skater, with good technique and a quick first step. He's not overly flashy, but on occasion he shows a dynamic offensive element. Gawdin finishes his checks with authority, gets back on defense, and gets in the opponent's lanes consistently. He was used in most situations for Swift Current, including being a go-to faceoff guy.</p>

<p>With Carlsson, it's more about the scouting projection as opposed to the statistical production, because there wasn't much of the latter. To put it simply: He's great defensively. He is always coming over the boards for any tough defensive zone draw, and to start most penalty kills. He's very smart in his own end, closing on his checks well, getting in lanes and disrupting offensive setups. His puck skills are not the greatest, but he can jump up into the play here and there.</p><p></p>

2014-15 GP: 69 | G: 28 | A: 35</strong></p>
<p>A big part of a pretty good Victoria team, Soy was leaned on to center the top line and play both special teams. He's not a fantastic skater, probably sitting around average but flashing a tick beyond there. Defensively, he's pretty effective in terms of his off-puck reads. He's a bit of a beanpole and does not project to have much of a physical game in the NHL.</p>

2014-15 GP: 68 | G: 10 | A: 30</strong></p>
<p>Capobianco was a rare bright spot in a dismal season for Sudbury and was one of the team's top scorers. Even on a brutal team, Capobianco has been able to generate offense from the back end with a very impressive combination of skating and skill. He has some two-way ability and a little bite, but his defensive reads and overall decision-making could use some work. He has a lot of upside and could be a great value pick in the mid rounds.</p>

DOB: 7/29/97 | Ht: 6-2 | Wt: 185<br>
2014-15 GP: 72 | G: 5 | A: 27</strong></p>
<p>The former No. 3 overall WHL pick is a very gifted defenseman with intriguing tools, despite a lack of production. Guhle is as mobile as some of the best defensemen available in this class. He's not a dynamic offensive player in the WHL, but shows flashes of his skill and puck-moving abilities. He is decent defensively, showing fine reads, but he's not that tough on his checks. Filling out his frame may help.</p>

DOB: 2/22/95 | Ht: 5-11 | Wt: 168<br>
2014-15 GP: 47 | G: 8 | A: 10</strong></p>
<p>Brodecki had a great season for an under-20 player in Sweden's top league, and he ticked up significantly in his third draft-eligible season. His hockey sense is a standout trait at both ends of the rink. Brodecki sees the options developing well as a playmaker, has good offensive creativity and the awareness to be an effective penalty killer. Brodecki has shown ability against pros to make things happen at both ends, but lacks the high-end "wow" factor and upside of others.</p>

DOB: 12/22/96 | Ht: 5-11 | Wt: 181<br>
2014-15 GP: 61 | G: 8 | A: 37</strong></p>
<p>After being selected in the ninth round in the OHL draft, he's seen his stock rise quite a bit this season. He's a two-way defenseman but his value is tiled more toward offense. He rarely forces plays, and makes good outlets under pressure. He's slightly undersized, but Dermott does battle hard for pucks and shows fine defensive IQ. Overall, his defensive-zone play projects to be about average as a pro, although he's been solid in that area as an OHLer.</p>

DOB: 4/4/96 | Ht: 5-10 | Wt: 161<br>
2014-15 GP: 68 | G: 43 | A: 61</strong></p>
<p>Mangiapane went undrafted after an impressive rookie OHL season, but he really turned his game up in his second draft-eligible campaign. His skating is excellent in all regards. His skill level isn't as high-end, but he makes a lot of plays. His defense isn't superb, but he's shown he can be an asset on the penalty kill. His physical game is the big question mark -- given his size -- and he may have issues against NHL defensemen.</p>

DOB: 8/5/97 | Ht: 5-11 | Wt: 181<br>
2014-15 GP: 32 | G: 4 | A: 0</strong></p>
<p>A bottom of the lineup player in Finland's top league this season, Tammela stood out at the under-18 level. He's dangerous off the rush with his speed and has also shown to be a short-handed threat. His size isn't ideal, but he battles hard. Tammela will be a good upside pick in the middle-to-late rounds, as he has the ability to break out if he's developed well.</p>

<p>Lauzon had a very solid second QMJHL season, being used in all situations for the Huskies. A really effective skater with impressive rushing speed, he has the ability to stick with quick forwards. He can be a little risky at times with the puck, but tends to make plays. Defensively, Lauzon plays the body and is a good poke checker.</p>

<p>A Texas-born player who comes out of a Massachusetts high school, one NHL scout calls him a "potential home run." Cotton is a player who shows above-average raw possession abilities between his puck skills and offensive creativity. He has good size, but scouts point out he's not particularly tough in battles. His skating isn't bad, but it's not a plus attribute, either. Like any high school prospect, most evaluators aren't sure what to make of Cotton's hockey IQ, given that there's concern about whether he makes great plays because he's a real prospect, or because he's a big kid playing high school hockey. He is committed to Boston College in 2016-17.</p>

2014-15 GP: 68 | G: 14 | A: 35</strong></p>
<p>Schemitsch was very impressive in his second full OHL season, playing in all manpower situations. Despite a filled-out frame, he's not overly physical. On the other hand, he's got a great wingspan and consistently lands his stick checks. Offensively, he's a little above-average. His upside as a two-way defenseman is intriguing, and he has the potential to be a sleeper candidate if his development continues at its current trajectory.</p><p></p>

<p>Compared to the much-anticipated 2013 NHL draft class -- a group that featured projected elite talents like <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041969/nathan-mackinnon">Nathan MacKinnon</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041992/seth-jones">Seth Jones</a> -- this year's prospect pool has been flying a little under the radar. But when you start to put the 2014 crop under the microscope, it's clear that there is still plenty of talent to be harvested.</p>

<div class="mod-content">
<h4>Prospect ranking methodology</h4>
<p>Rankings are based on discussions with scouts on top of video and live viewings, and place a slight emphasis on puck possession, based on studies that show it is the <a href="http://vhockey.blogspot.com/2009/05/possession-is-everything.html" target="new">best predictive measure</a> of team-level success. Performance is a secondary factor, adjusted for age, team strength, league quality and other contextual elements.</p> 
<p>Defensemen are given slightly less value than forwards of equal skill level because of higher projection uncertainty inherent in the position. </p> 
</div>
</div>
<!-- END INLINE MODULE --><!-- end inline 1 --></p>
<p>To put it in perspective, compared to last year's draft class (without our current hindsight), I'd have ranked <strong>Aaron Ekblad</strong> behind MacKinnon and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041971/jonathan-drouin">Jonathan Drouin</a>, with a tough debate about how close he was to Jones and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3042003/valeri-nichushkin">Valeri Nichushkin</a>. He'd have ranked ahead of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041970/aleksander-barkov">Aleksander Barkov</a>, however. I'd then have <strong>Sam Bennett</strong> and the rest of the top tier after Barkov.</p>
<p>Although the No. 1 and 2 prospects are below average compared to the players who have fallen in that range historically, the middle of the top end -- the Nos. 5 to 10 range -- is somewhat <em>above&nbsp;</em>average. This draft may not be one that produces superstars, but there are some very useful players here.</p>
<p>There is a slight drop-off after Ekblad, and the next tier runs three prospects deep, with another tier from Nos. 5 to 9. There's a good argument to fit any of the next seven prospects after the No. 9 slot into that group, but the rest of the draft is a gradual decline from there.</p>
<p>The OHL is represented well, with 10 players in the top 30. This is also a strong year for European leagues, particularly the Swedish ones, as for the first time those leagues emerged as the preferred alternative for top non-Swedish prospects overseas. <strong>Kevin Fiala</strong> (Switzerland) as well as <strong>David Pastrnak</strong> and <strong>Jakub Vrana</strong> (Czech Republic) played in Sweden's top leagues and developed well.</p>
<p>It's also a comparatively strong class in terms of netminders, led by <strong>Thatcher Demko</strong>. However, this is a poor year for defensemen. After my No. 1 overall prospect, Ekblad, it's a big drop to <strong>Haydn Fleury</strong> (No. 10), and on the whole, there are only four defensemen in my top 30 skaters.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this is a personal ranking, and I am aware it does not necessarily reflect an industry consensus. For example, it is likely that both <strong>Leon Draisaitl</strong> (No. 7) and <strong>Michael Dal Colle</strong> (No. 8) go in the top five June 27.</p>
<p>With the stage now set, here's how the top 100 prospects stack up, with specific ranking explanations for the prospects in that top nine-man group:</p><p></p>

<p><b>1. Aaron Ekblad | D | Barrie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 2/7/96 | 2013-14 stats: 58 GP, 23 G, 30 A, 91 PIM</b></p>
<p>The second player tagged with "Exceptional" status in the OHL -- between <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5160/john-tavares">John Tavares</a> and Connor McDavid -- Ekblad is the top player in the 2014 draft class. He's a monster on the back end at 6-foot-4, 216 pounds, and plays the game with an edge. Some may point to his size as the reason Ekblad dominates, but he does so much more than just hit and win battles: he skates well with good power in his stride and excellent pivots; he has really developed the offensive side of his game, with above-average puck skills and great coordination for a big man; he sees the ice well, can be creative along the point and join the attack on top of having a high-end shot from deep. Ekblad doesn't have any outstanding skills in particular, and he can still make an odd mistake, but the total package of what he brings to the table is unique, especially considering he's a blueliner. He's a potential star defenseman and may have another level to his game if developed properly.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> The reason for my choice at No. 1 is two-fold: Ekblad is a superior talent to Bennett, and though he has risks, they were not enough to keep him from losing the top spot. It's rare that we encounter a big, strong defender like Ekblad with the natural hockey skills he has. You add to that his high-end to elite hockey IQ in both ends of the rink, and a huge shot, and the total package looks like a player who has an NHL All-Star floor, and the ceiling of an elite NHL defenseman. Bennett is strong in a lot of areas, but not elite in any one of them. It is not as though we are debating an elite defenseman prospect versus a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5037/steven-stamkos">Steven Stamkos</a> or Tavares type at No. 1. Although defensemen are notably more difficult to project -- and bust more often -- he's certainly worth it compared to the other top options in this class.</p>
<p><b>2. Sam Bennett | C | Kingston (OHL)<br>
DOB: 6/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 57 GP, 36 G, 55 A, 118 PIM</b></p>
<p>It's hard to find a specific part of Bennett's game that is weak; he's simply a fantastic all-around forward. He's a really fast and energetic skater who can play at a high pace and embrace a pressure style with high amounts of effectiveness. However, Bennett's best quality is his hockey IQ. He sees the ice really well, and can dominate the puck in terms of possession due to his hockey brain on top of his speed and puck skills. Bennett has flashy elements to his game, while also being able to generate chances through work ethic and instincts, and has an impressive shot as well. Bennett battles well for pucks, with what one NHL exec coins "superb natural balance" in terms of his center of gravity in board confrontations. He also embraces the physical game, can lay some quality hits and is a fine defensive forward. He could get stronger, improve his positioning a little, and maybe not try to force the tough plays, but for the most part he's the complete package.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Bennett, Sam Reinhart and William Nylander were in the same tier for much of the season, with Bennett pushing ahead in the past few months. As opposed to the much more complex explanation of Ekblad versus Bennett, this one is more straightforward. While Nylander is a much better puck handler, with better vision and hockey IQ, Bennett has the positional edge and is a better skater than Nylander, with more defensive value as well. Bennett carries notably less risk in my eyes, with a marginally lower ceiling.</p>
<p><b>3. William Nylander | RW | Modo (SHL)<br>
DOB: 5/1/96 | 2013-14 stats: 22 GP, 1 G, 6 A, 6 PIM</b></p>
<p>The son of longtime NHLer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/686/michael-nylander">Michael Nylander</a> may be the most gifted pure offensive talent in the draft. William had a so-so first half when he struggled to find a role, but had a tremendous second half. Because of that turnaround, I've heard NHL scouts rank him anywhere from No. 2 overall to the 20s. He was over a point per game pace with Sodertalje in the SHL-2, setting a season record for points by an under-18 player, and played around 20 minutes per game with Modo down the stretch. Nylander's pucks skills are elite, as he can be described as "an artist" by some scouts in terms of how well he controls the puck, and the unique plays he makes. Nylander's hockey sense is fantastic as well, in terms of his vision, and offensive intellect. You combine that with a pretty good top gear and Nylander can create all sorts of havoc offensively. Nylander can deke a defender out, make a highlight-reel pass, speed by players. He's not the biggest guy (5-11, 181 pounds), his defensive play needs work, and he can try to do too much sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Nylander has a better skill level than Reinhart, but Reinhart is better physically, and <em>worlds</em> better defensively. Nylander has more upside than Reinhart, but carries more risk in terms of his all-around game. Reinhart's probably a better player right now, but Nylander is in his 17-year-old season (as compared to Reinhart being in his 18-year-old season) and Nylander seems to have more room to grow. For the latter reason, being that I think he has so much upside, and it's easier to close the gap defensively than offensively for an under-20 player, I give the edge to Nylander.</p>

<p><b>4. Sam Reinhart | C | Kootenay (WHL)<br>
DOB: 11/6/95 | 2013-14 stats: 60 GP, 36 G, 69 A, 11 PIM</b></p>
<p>The best of the three Reinhart brothers -- <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2976832/griffin-reinhart">Griffin Reinhart</a> is with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/nyi/new-york-islanders">New York Islanders</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5585/max-reinhart">Max Reinhart</a> is with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/cgy/calgary-flames">Calgary Flames</a> -- is a dynamic right-handed center, and is the best pure passer in the draft class. His ability to dictate tempo elevates his game to a distinct level. Reinhart can make all kinds of plays with the puck, and his elite hockey sense stands out regularly in terms of the passing lanes he sees that even an observer with a bird's-eye view may not spot. He has great hands and can make a lot of plays when he goes one-on-one against a defenseman. He has average size (6-1, 183 pounds), but will work hard in battles and can play an average physical game, although I have heard some scouts criticize him in that area. One of the skills that distinguishes Reinhart is his smart play in the defensive zone, shutting down top players and possessing top-quality abilities on the penalty kill.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> There was a bit of a drop-off at this point, so the decision wasn't too hard to put Reinhart over Ehlers. Ehlers is a much better skater, and may be slightly more skilled. That isn't enough to balance out the fact that Reinhart thinks and sees the game at a much higher level, with substantially better defense. He is also bigger, and is a right-handed center who plays the position well.</p>
<p><b>5. Nikolaj Ehlers | LW | Halifax (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 2/14/96 | 2013-14 stats: 63 GP, 49 G, 55 A, 51 PIM</b></p>
<p>The Danish Ehlers landed in North America with a bang, scoring well over a point-per-game pace in his rookie QMJHL season. He's an electrifying offensive talent who stands out on a regular basis. His skating is easily plus -- especially his top gear -- as he turns defenders regularly. Ehlers generates speed so easily with his first few steps and has a clean, easy stride. He complements that with a large arsenal of stick-handling moves. One scout notes that Ehlers doesn't just ooze skill, but he can make all the tough skill plays at a high tempo. He sees the ice pretty well, and can make the really difficult passes. He's got an above-average shot, with smooth technique on his snap, and the puck explodes quickly off his tape. Ehlers isn't the biggest guy (6-0, 163 pounds) or the most physical, although he battles well. His pure scoring potential is what gets him in the conversation here.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Ehlers and Kevin Fiala are pretty similar players. Both are small, dynamic offensive wingers who had big breakout seasons to become elite prospects. Ehlers is a much better skater, while Fiala has better puck-possession tools. They're both around the same in terms of developing their physical game and play off the puck. I lean to Ehlers in this slot due to the fact I've been more impressed in quantity of viewings I've had of him and notes I've gotten from scouts, but it's a coin-flip call.</p>
<p><b>6. Kevin Fiala | LW | HV71 (SHL)<br>
DOB: 7/22/96 | 2013-14 stats: 17 GP, 3 G, 8 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>The next great Swiss prospect, Fiala really started to turn heads from about December on. He had a strong World Junior Championship and under-18 World Championship, started playing top-six minutes in the SHL, putting up a ton of points in the process. In terms of points per game, he had the second-highest rate in the SHL among under-18 players in modern history, behind <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/284/peter-forsberg">Peter Forsberg</a>. He can make highlight-reel plays with the puck, and he's also a really good passer with great hockey IQ, and doesn't seem to turn the puck over. On the power play, Fiala is the kind of player you want controlling the puck and starting the puck movement. He's 5-11, and while that isn't ideal, he does battle hard and has a lot of drive to his game. Fiala needs to improve his defensive positioning.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Fiala is a better if not <em>much</em> better skater than Draisaitl, with better pure skill and hands. They're close in terms of hockey sense and vision, with Draisaitl having a massive advantage in terms of size and physical game. All decisions within a tier are tough, but what made me lean toward Fiala is how he differentiated himself: He looks unique on the ice and had a unique season. That stands out to me since one of the main purposes of the draft for teams is obtaining stars as opposed to good/very good players who can be more easily gained through free agency. I'm not saying Leon can't be the former -- he very well could be -- but Fiala looks like that possibility is greater for him, even if he carries more risk. Draisaitl looks like a standard top-end 18-year-old prospect.</p>
<p><b>7. Leon Draisaitl | C | Prince Albert (WHL)<br>
DOB: 10/27/95 | 2013-14 stats: 64 GP, 38 G, 67 A, 24 PIM</b></p>
<p>Leon is one of the best -- if not <em>the </em>best -- NHL prospects to come out of Germany as a first-time draft-eligible player. He measures in at 6-1 and 209 pounds, with the ability to protect the puck at a high level. Draisaitl shows a good strength level and competitiveness in battles. His hockey sense is also exceptional as he processes the game at a really quick tempo. This translates to his best offensive quality: his vision. Draisaitl's quick passing skills, knowledge of how to make defenders move to open lanes, and the creativity he shows as a playmaker are unique, and make him a dangerous player from inside the offensive blue line. He's also got some flash to his game, and his defense is solid. When he gets going, his speed is average but his first few steps are a bit sluggish and his stride isn't the cleanest.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Dal Colle doesn't have the standout skill of Nylander, Fiala or Ehlers, or the well-rounded game of Reinhart. He's just a very talented offensive player but not elite, and a player who needs to work on his off-puck game. However, like most of the players in this top tier, I see a reasonable case to move him mostly anywhere in the top range. He's a better skater than Draisaitl with the same amount of skill, and a better shot, but I like Leon's sense and physical game more, which is enough to edge him ahead.</p>
<p><b>8. Michael Dal Colle | LW | Oshawa (OHL)<br>
DOB: 6/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 69 GP, 39 G, 56 A, 34 PIM</b></p>
<p>"Puck possessor" is the common word thrown around when scouts discuss Dal Colle. "He makes all the right plays, he's very patient, he sees the ice well, and his team always has the puck when he's out there," said one NHL head scout. Dal Colle's puck skills and instincts make him a force when he's on the ice, but what makes him a top-end prospect is the size he brings to the table (6-2, 172 pounds), on top of the fantastic skill components. He also possesses a high-end shot. In terms of pure offensive potential and skills, he's right in the same category as Reinhart and Bennett. I have heard from some scouts who like his skating, although I see him as more average in that regard. He'll have some good moments in the defensive zone, but could stand to work on his positioning. He could also stand to be less bashful in corner play.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Kapanen is a much better skater than Dal Colle, but I find Dal Colle to be more skilled, and Dal Colle is also a bigger player. In addition, I have fewer questions in terms of production about Dal Colle, and combined with a slightly better skill set that makes me lean to him in this spot.</p>
<p><b>9. Kasperi Kapanen | RW | KalPa (Liiga)<br>
DOB: 7/23/96| 2013-14 stats: 47 GP, 7 G, 7 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>The son of longtime NHLer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/431/sami-kapanen">Sami Kapanen</a> is a dynamic offensive player. He was a top player at the under-18 championships as an under-age level player, and would have played a top-six role for Finland at the WJC had he not been injured. His production in Finland's top league was not great, but keep in mind that his team was historically bad this season. Kapanen is a very good skater with a blistering first few steps and an above-average top gear. He sees the ice at a high-end level, and regularly makes all kinds of impressive passes. His ability to generate through his own skills and to set up others is what puts him here. Kapanen also has a good shot, and works hard in battles. He needs to work on his defense, and is undersized (6-0, 181 pounds) but is pretty strong.</p>
<p><b>Ranking explanation:</b> Given the type of player Kapanen is -- a high-end skater with great skill, hockey IQ, finishing ability and intangibles -- he projects as a potential top-line forward. Fleury is a big, mobile defender, with fine defensive skills, and has a similar top-end type of projection as Kapanen. Given the similarities, the tie goes to the forward, due to less projection risk.</p>
<p><b>10. Haydn Fleury | D | Red Deer (WHL)<br>
DOB: 7/8/96 | 2013-14 stats: 70 GP, 8 G, 38 A, 46 PIM</b></p>
<p>Fleury is one of the two defenders in this class with legitimate top-pairing upside. He is a 6-3, 200-pound defender who plays the body frequently, and does it well; he projects as a high-end physical player at the top level if he continues to grow into his body. He's also very mobile in every direction, he's got a great top speed to rush the puck, and he's agile with his turns/pivots and tight space maneuvering. Fleury also has the ability to QB a power play. His main drawback is his hockey sense, as he can be an overly risky player who can try to do too much, and make costly turnovers. He has some good stretches defensively, coupled with some stretches that make you hide your eyes. He could be a potential two-way horse in the NHL if he fully pans out.</p>
<p><b>11. Jake Virtanen | RW | Calgary (WHL)<br>
DOB: 8/17/96 | 2013-14 stats: 71 GP, 45 G, 26 A, 100 PIM</b></p>
<p>Virtanen is an all-engines-go type of player who put up a ton of goals in his second WHL season. His best attribute is his skating, and he may be the best skater in this draft class. "He has that second gear to blow by defenders that other players don't have," said one scout. Virtanen's ability to gain the zone is very desirable and he's a player you want with the puck in transition because of his speed and impressive puck skills. He forechecks well, hustles to get his defensive assignments and plays hard on the penalty kill. Virtanen shot is plus, as he gets it off quick, with torque and accuracy. He won't be a team's primary puck carrier or scoring-chance creator, but there's budding upside with Virtanen on that front if he continues to develop well.</p>
<p><strong>12. Sonny Milano | LW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 58 GP, 29 G, 57 A, 23 PIM</strong></p>
<p>Milano put up giant scoring numbers with the USNTDP compared to even what most top forwards have done in the past. Some of it was due to playing on a line with elite 2015 draft prospect Jack Eichel, but he was not a passenger on that train. When you watch Milano, "soft hands" and "offensive instincts" are the things that stand out immediately, and what I heard scouts say about him. His puck skills and offensive hockey sense are among the best in the draft. He's not selfish with the puck, as he sees the ice and distributes at a high level. Milano is also a good if not an excellent skater with high-end acceleration. His defense is not amazing, but he's improved significantly in that area, even taking on some PK duty for the NTDP. His most notable weaknesses are his size (5-11, 185 pounds) and strength, and he can turn the puck over a little too much with his flashy plays. He is committed to Boston College for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>13. Jakub Vrana | RW | Linkoping (SHL)<br>
DOB: 2/28/96 | 2013-14 stats: 24 GP, 2 G, 1 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>This is a pretty high ranking, but it's slightly lower than I expected I'd end up slotting Vrana earlier this season, as he looked like one of the greatest Czech prospects in recent memory. He's one of the few Czech players to ever play as an under-age player for their under-18 and under-20 teams, alongside <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3802/michael-frolik">Michael Frolik</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2120/jiri-hudler">Jiri Hudler</a>. There's a reasonable best-case scenario with Vrana that he'll become a top-end winger and I'll end up cringing looking back at ranking him too low. Vrana is a shifty player, with very good speed and a nice first few steps. His defense could use work. He also can try to do too much and be selfish at times. The most troubling thing with Vrana is that his development seems to be flattening out, and a downward trend is always a red flag, so there's also a non-zero chance that he busts.</p>
<p><b>14. Brendan Perlini | LW | Niagara (OHL)<br>
DOB: 4/27/96 | 2013-14 stats: 58 GP, 34 G, 37 A, 36 PIM</b></p>
<p>Perlini showed immense improvements from his 16-year-old season to this one, and emerged as one of the top first-time draft-eligible forwards. A Great Britain native, Perlini has probably the best size-to-skating ratio in the draft. He's a 6-3, 200-pound winger and gets up the ice at an elite level; Perlini's first-step quickness for his size is extremely impressive. His physical package and skill level make him a very desirable power forward-type of prospect if he improves in the physical part of the game. Perlini has quick hands and the offensive composure to make plays in tight spaces. He's also a great scorer who can finish from mid-distance. Perlini has the ability to be a game-breaker, and while he still needs to find that consistency in terms of creation and two-way play, he can be a major factor in a game.</p>
<p><strong>15. Robby Fabbri | C | Guelph (OHL)<br>
DOB: 1/22/96 | 2013-14 stats: 58 GP, 45 G, 42 A, 55 PIM</strong></p>
<p>Fabbri put up a lot of points on a very gifted OHL team, but then again, he was a big part of why they scored so many goals. Fabbri is an above-average skater who has good natural speed, but with his great work ethic he's a player who jets up and down the ice. Fabbri gets on defensemen quickly, and his skating makes him a dangerous short-handed goal threat on the penalty kill. Fabbri sees his options well, understands where to be and what plays to make to generate scoring chances. He's got an accurate shot, although it could use more zip. He's not the biggest guy (5-10, 166 pounds), and that's his biggest weakness, if not his only real notable issue. Fabbri does battle really well, however, and will initiate contact, which is an element you want to see in the smaller players.</p>
<p><b>16. David Pastrnak | RW | Sodertalje (Allsvenskan)<br>
DOB: 5/25/96| 2013-14 stats: 36 GP, 8 G, 16 A, 24 PIM</b></p>
<p>Pastrnak had one of the most productive seasons in the lower Swedish league for an under-18 forward in decades, despite a late back injury that kept him out of the under-18 championships. His 24 points in 36 games surpassed <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2968772/filip-forsberg">Filip Forsberg</a>'s 17 points when the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/nsh/nashville-predators">Nashville Predators</a> prospect was in this situation. Pastrnak is a smooth, coordinated puck handler who can make the tough evasive moves on a frequent basis. His hockey IQ is really high, as he sees all his options, processes the game very quickly and understands how to play with pace. He's a good skater with shiftiness and an above-average top gear, who also possesses a quick release on his shot. Pastrnak's main weakness is his physical game, as he loses a fair amount of battles.</p>
<p><b>17. Ivan Barbashev | C | Moncton (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 12/14/95 | 2013-14 stats: 48 GP, 25 G, 43 A, 27 PIM</b></p>
<p>Barbashev has been on the prospect radar for several years. He was a top scorer at last year's under-18 championships, was the top overall pick in the CHL Import Draft and received a lot of praise from Russian scouts before he transferred. He's the kind of player who can be set up on the point on a power play, due to the way he can control the puck and see all the options. What makes Barbashev dangerous at even strength is his skill level, but also his intangibles. He's a very hard worker who is plays with a physical edge and can land some crushing blows. He's committed defensively with fine skills on the penalty kill. He needs to get stronger and be a little more consistent offensively, but there aren't a ton of nits to pick with Barbashev.</p>

DOB: 12/5/95 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 39 G, 35 A, 136 PIM</b></p>
<p>Prior to this season, Ritchie struggled with injuries and consistency, but he got on more of a solid footing in 2013-14. His toolkit is tremendous, and at his best he can be dominant. Ritchie's physical game is fantastic. He's 6-3, 235 pounds and aggressive. Ritchie attacks defenders, and is great protecting the puck. It will obviously be harder on him in the pro game, but it was near-impossible to get the puck off of him at the junior level. Ritchie's strength level is great, and I've seen bulldoze through people on the way to the net, and shoulder off multiple checks without much effort. He's got a good skill level, too. Ritchie's shot is of the high-end variety with a lot of weight behind his snaps. His defense needs some work, and he has a tendency to disappear at times (which is difficult for such a large player).</p>
<p><b>19. Jared McCann | C | Sault Ste. Marie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 5/3/96 | 2013-14 stats: 64 GP, 27 G, 35 A, 51 PIM</b></p>
<p>McCann is a gifted all-around player, and has a strong hockey IQ. His hockey sense translates to plus creativity, vision, positioning and defensive awareness. He regularly lined up against the opponents' best players in tough even-strength minutes, and was effective in doing so. He's an above-average stick handler who won't try to be a hero, but can make tough plays to evade pressure and create chances. He'll also pull off the occasional highlight-reel play. His best offensive asset in the attacking zone is his shot. He's got a bullet, and can score from a distance -- and at times, overshoot. McCann certainly needs to get stronger, and despite a good physical work ethic he projects as a below-average physical player at the top level.</p>
<p><b>20. Josh Ho-Sang | RW | Windsor (OHL)<br>
DOB: 1/22/96 | 2013-14 stats: 67 GP, 32 G, 53 A, 44 PIM</b></p>
<p>Ho-Sang is one of the toughest players to evaluate in this draft. On raw talent, he's a clear top-10 prospect and maybe even in the top five. Scouts can't praise his skill level enough. He's one of the best skaters in the draft; his first few steps and overall stride are high end, and his top speed is elite. Ho-Sang is also a high-end if not better puck handler. This combination allows him to be a dynamic player who can create scoring chances out of nothing. However, Ho-Sang can struggle at times with his decision making with the puck, frequently turning it over or trying to do too much. Off the puck, he's a work in progress. He has top-line tools, but more risk than the rest of the top tier of prospects.</p>
<p><b>21. Alex Tuch | RW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/10/96 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 29 G, 35 A, 70 PIM</b></p>
<p>Tuch really elevated his game as a prospect this season, improving significantly in several areas while playing on the top line for the NTDP alongside Eichel and Milano. He's a giant at 6-4, 215 pounds, with a lot of skill. He's highly creative, and is at his best from the hashmarks in. Tuch protects the puck quite well and can be very effective in the cycle. He won't bulldoze guys, but is pretty physical and due to his size/strength wins a lot of battles. Tuch's skating has gotten better, but still has room for improvement. He also needs to improve his defensive positioning and awareness.</p>
<p><b>22. Adrian Kempe | LW | Modo (SHL)<br>
DOB: 9/13/96 | 2013-14 stats: 45 GP, 5 G, 6 A, 12 PIM</b></p>
<p>Kempe is a great power winger who showed flashes in the SHL this season on top of quality under-18 showings. He's one of the better skaters available, with the first-few-step acceleration and overall top gear to simply fly through the neutral zone and pressure defenders. When you combine Kempe's speed with a strong frame and a willingness to attack the net, he becomes a dangerous physical threat. His hand-eye coordination allows him to control the puck well and be dangerous getting his stick on pucks in front of the net. Kempe can play center somewhat effectively, in addition to his natural wing slot. He needs to improve his pace and reads, as he can get a little lost in the play at times.</p>
<p><b>23. Roland McKeown | D | Kingston (OHL)<br>
DOB: 1/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 62 GP, 11 G, 32 A, 61 PIM</b></p>
<p>McKeown was one of the top rookies in the OHL as a 16-year-old, and followed it up with a very good 17-year-old season, including a defenseman of the year nomination. His best skill is his skating, as McKeown is one of the better skaters available in the class. Regularly, you see him get closer to the play than most defenders would, because he has the ability to recover easily. His pivots and backwards speed are all impressive as well. McKeown outlets the puck very well and while he may not make a highlight-reel rush he can execute pretty difficult passes. His defensive game has grown a ton over the past 12 months, so much that he has earned tough minutes responsibilities in Kingston. He be a little too aggressive with his decision making at times, but mostly he tends to make the right calls. He needs to be a little tougher on his checks.</p>
<p><b>24. Nikita Scherbak | RW | Saskatoon (WHL)<br>
DOB: 12/30/95 | 2013-14 stats: 54 GP, 26 G, 43 A, 28 PIM</b></p>
<p>Scherbak was a huge riser this season. He was a relative unknown on the draft radar in the summer, but had a huge 18-year-old rookie season in the WHL. He's a really interesting player because he has so many tools and the character to keep improving and learning about the North American game. His vision creates a lot, but he just understands where to go, what to do, and how to make all the right plays at a high speed to create offense. "His sense of timing is great," said one scout. His stride is pretty clean and can show a good bursts of speed, although I'm not sure he's a blazer. I think with improved strength, his skating has notable room to grow and excel. His defense isn't the best, but it isn't a major issue.</p>
<p><b>25. Brayden Point | C | Moose Jaw (WHL)<br>
DOB: 3/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 36 G, 55 A, 53 PIM</b></p>
<p>Point led Moose Jaw in scoring this season, after a great 16-year-old campaign in 2012-13 when he was second in team scoring. Point is a high-pace player who brings speed and intensity to every shift. I've heard scouts grade him as an above-average skater, with the odd one qualifying him as high end in that area. He's a player who plays bigger than his size (5-9, 161 pounds), with unusually good physical and defensive value for a smaller player. Point has above-average puck skills and vision, and can show some pretty significant moments in the skill area. He also is a pretty good shooter. Point's major flaw is his size, and I'm not sure if he has enough skill to be a big-time scorer in light of that. However, I have enough confidence in his all-around game and the talent he has displayed to rank him at this level.</p>
<p><b>26. Dylan Larkin | C | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 7/30/96| 2013-14 stats: 60 GP, 31 G, 25 A, 56 PIM</b></p>
<p>Larkin is one of the top power forwards available in this year's draft class, and is an outstanding skater, one of the best in the class. He has a fine but not outstanding amount of skill, but gains the offensive zone very often due to his skating ability. Larkin has average size (6-0, 192 pounds), but he's pretty strong on the puck and has a fantastic on-ice work ethic. He drives the net, muscles out opponents in battles and gets back on defense effectively. He kills penalties well and he can be a shorthanded scoring threat. Another plus: Larkin plays both wing and center effectively. He's committed to the University of Michigan for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>27. Conner Bleackley | C | Red Deer (WHL)<br>
DOB: 7/2/96| 2013-14 stats: 71 GP, 29 G, 39 A, 48 PIM</b></p>
<p>Bleackley trended up this season in a significant way, and developed into a legitimate two-way forward for Red Deer. He logged big minutes in all situations, which is the kind of player he projects to being as a pro. He's a very hard-working forward who "competes so hard in every area of the ice, every shift," per one scout. Bleackley kills penalties effectively, and anticipates the flow of the offensive pressure well. He's also a very astute thinker on the offensive side of the puck. Bleackley has a fine strength level right now, but certainly has more room to grow on that front. His skating is decent, however.</p>
<p><b>28. Nikolai Goldobin | RW | Sarnia (OHL)<br>
DOB: 10/7/95| 2013-14 stats: 67 GP, 38 G, 56 A, 21 PIM</b></p>
<p>Goldobin was one of the top scorers in the OHL in his second season in the league; his pure offensive skill package is outstanding, one of the best in the class. He's a gifted playmaker, which allows him to be the primary creator on the power play from the side wall. Goldobin sees his options quickly, and delivers all his passes on the tape even if he has to elevate the puck. He projects as a fantastic power-play asset at the NHL level. At the risk of furthering a stereotype about Russian forwards, Goldobin's main issues are off the puck. He needs to win more battles, gain strength and improve his defense.</p>
<p><b>29. Julius Honka | D | Swift Current (WHL)<br>
DOB: 12/3/95 | 2013-14 stats: 62 GP, 16 G, 40 A, 52 PIM</b></p>
<p>Honka hit the ground running in his first season in North America, looking substantially better as a prospect than when he played in Europe. The factor that's really elevated his play has been his improvement defensively, which has allowed him to be leaned on more in tough minutes (and will be pivotal to his having a big role in the NHL). His physical game remains a major liability, as he's small (5-11, 174 pounds), not that strong, and not an intimidating guy when contact is initiated. Overall, he can play a risky style of game, but most of the time he doesn't get caught and knows how to make the most of his offensive gifts without giving up too much on the back end.</p>
<p><b>30. Nick Schmaltz | C | Green Bay (USHL)<br>
DOB: 2/23/96 | 2013-14 stats: 55 GP, 18 G, 45 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>Schmaltz has been a top scorer in the USHL for the past two seasons, and is the younger brother of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/stl/st-louis-blues">St. Louis Blues</a> prospect <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2976853/jordan-schmaltz">Jordan Schmaltz</a>. Nick's puck skills and pure creativity allow him to make a lot of defenders miss, and create scoring chances at times when it doesn't look like there is an opportunity. Schmaltz has pretty good possession skills as well. "He can own the puck during a game," said one NHL scout. Schmaltz isn't the biggest guy in the class (6-0, 172 pounds), so he needs to bulk up, and play less bashfully in battles. High risk, high reward is the school of thought among NHL scouts with Schmaltz. He is committed to North Dakota for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>31. Sebastian Aho | D | Skelleftea (SHL)<br>
DOB: 2/17/96 | 2013-14 stats: 21 GP, 1 G, 4 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>Aho had a good draft season, where he worked his way to get a regular shift on one of the top teams in Sweden's top league. His puck-moving skills are exceptional; if you want a patient, aware defender with vision to outlet from the defensive zone or control the power play, Aho is your prospect. Aho skates very well, with a quality stride, excellent footwork on his crossovers and pivots, and the four-way mobility to close in on targets and get up in the attack. Aho has one glaring weakness in that he's undersized at 5-9, 165 pounds. It's why scouts who love what he's shown internationally and in Sweden still have skepticism about whether he can be an NHL player, because it's so tough for small defensemen to get in a lineup. Those concerns are legitimate, but not enough to push aside all the positive qualities about his game.</p>
<p><b>32. Travis Sanheim | D | Calgary (WHL)<br>
DOB: 3/29/96 | 2013-14 stats: 67 GP, 5 G, 24 A, 14 PIM</b></p>
<p>Sanheim wasn't on the radar as a top-100 prospect early in the season, but he really picked up his play in the second half and elevated himself into the conversation. He has effective size (6-3, 181 pounds) and offensive skill, and his puck-moving ability increased as the season progressed. Sanheim has very good mobility with an effortless, powerful stride and the evasiveness you don't typically see with a player his size. His speed allows him to be a threat leading the rush. He isn't an overly physical player, but with his reach and IQ he's able to be strong defensively and makes a fair number of stops.</p>
<p><b>33. Vladislav Kamanev | LW | Magnitogorsk (KHL)<br>
DOB: 8/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 16 GP, 1 G, 0 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>Kamanev was the No. 3 overall pick in the 2013 KHL draft, and played the most KHL games this season among under-18 players. He's a skilled puck handler, but can try to get too fancy sometimes. Unlike the stereotype of skilled Russians, Kamanev plays physical and has some defensive value. He's a 6-2, 200-pound player who can protect the puck quite well, and battles for pucks in his own end. His skating, however, can use some work; he's not slow, but he's about average in that area.</p>
<p><b>34. Spencer Watson | RW | Kingston (OHL)<br>
DOB: 4/25/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 33 G, 35 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>Watson started off the draft season leading the Ivan Hlinka memorial tournament in scoring, and had his second straight productive OHL season. While he's not among the elite talents in his age group, he's a very gifted scorer with a lot of offensive ability. Watson has the ability to make highlight-reel plays due to his creativity with the puck. "[Watson's] one of the more dangerous draft prospects from the offensive zone in," said one NHL executive. He is an above-average passer, and can make impressive plays under pressure and in tight spaces. Watson is a great finisher, who can score from a distance but also understands how to bury the puck when playing in tight. He's small at 5-10, 166 pounds, and is not great defensively or in the skating department.</p>
<p><b>35. Anton Karlsson | LW | Frolunda (J20SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 8/3/96 | 2013-14 stats: 28 GP, 12 G, 10 A, 88 PIM</b></p>
<p>Karlsson is interesting due to all the different ways he can affect a game. He was the sole under-18 player for Sweden at the WJC, has been decent in league play this season, and has been up and down in international showings the past two seasons. Karlsson is an aggressive, agitating forward who pressures well and attacks the net. However, he also has a good skill set. Karlsson is the type of player who can deliver a hit, get a takeaway, and make a skill play afterwards to create a scoring chance. He's also an effective penalty killer. The main criticisms of Karlsson are his consistency and his decisions. His potential is significant, and makes him a desirable prospect.</p>
<p><b>36. Vladimir Tkachev | RW | Moncton (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 10/5/95 | 2013-14 stats: 20 GP, 10 G, 20 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>A high risk, high reward-type of player, Tkachev's offensive hockey mind is one of the best in this draft class, as he can do things with the puck that bring people out of their seats. He processes the game at a good pace and can be a flashy distributor on top of the dazzle he shows with his individual puck skills. Tkachev's understanding of how to make plays under pressure and in tight spaces is a standout element of his game, and it's what allows him to maintain puck control for lengthy periods. He has above-average speed with good agility, although he's not the ideal blazer for a small player. Tkachev's defense isn't great, but it's passable. The physical game is his biggest weakness, which is not surprising given his size (5-8, 163 pounds).</p>
<p><b>37. Anthony DeAngelo | D | Sarnia (OHL)<br>
DOB: 10/24/95 | 2013-14 stats: 51 GP, 15 G, 56 A, 90 PIM</b></p>
<p>DeAngelo is one of the toughest prospects to get a read on in this year's class. His numbers as a 17- and 18-year-old in the OHL have been outstanding, but there are notable question marks on his game from a scouting standpoint. I've heard his skating described by scouts as anywhere from good to great, with my observations leaning to the latter. He can play with pace, and makes creative plays. DeAngelo is not the biggest guy -- at 5-11, 168 pounds -- and while he competes on the ice, he tends to lose his fair share of battles. He has a long way to go defensively. On top of his flaws in the physical game, he often gets beat by skilled players and really needs to work on his angles/positioning. He can also be too risky with the puck, turning it over more than he should.</p>

<p>Audette is the son of longtime NHLer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/31/donald-audette">Donald Audette</a>, and was the first overall pick in the 2012 QMJHL draft. His skill level is great, as he can make plays better than all but a few in this draft class. His high-end vision allows him to make the passes of moderate difficulty look routine, and he can make the high-difficulty ones with good frequency. Audette is a tremendous power-play asset who can be the primary source of chances. Audette's size is his biggest weakness: He's 5-8, 176 pounds, and his physical limitations make his potential NHL even-strength production questionable.</p>
<p><b>39. Eric Cornel | RW | Peterborough (OHL)<br>
DOB: 4/11/96 | 2013-14 stats: 68 GP, 25 G, 37 A, 25 PIM</b></p>
<p>Cornel was the third overall pick in his OHL draft (2012) who underwhelmed as a 16-year-old but took big steps forward in his 17-year-old season. He's a skilled puck-possession forward with top-six upside at the NHL level, if some things go right in his development. He generates scoring chances regularly, as he has high-end offensive instincts, and is poised in possession. As with many skilled prospects, he can try to do too much on the ice, turning the puck over. He works hard, but his off-puck reads and value are underwhelming. Cornel is not the best defensively, needs to bulk up, and isn't the best in the physical game, despite his 6-2, 185-pound frame. He has the ability to overcome that as he develops, but it's a fault right now.</p>
<p><b>40. Joe Hicketts | D | Victoria (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/4/96 | 2013-14 stats: 36 GP, 6 G, 18 A, 12 PIM</b></p>
<p>Hicketts is short (5-8), and missed a large chunk of this season due to injury. Excited yet? Well, here's all the good news about him: He's an exceptional skater who closes his gaps really well, is sound technically with his footwork and has an easy burst that he generates from each stride. He hits with the impact of a much bigger player. He's a tenacious defenseman who embraces the physical part of the game. With the puck, Hicketts has put up a lot of points in his limited playing time. He's an aware puck distributor who can jump into the play and is creative in how he tries to generate offense.</p>

DOB: 9/5/95 | 2013-14 stats: 41 GP, 3 G, 7 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>It was a mild surprise when Wallmark went undrafted in 2013, despite being one of the top forwards for the Swedish under-18 team. Health and skating scared teams away then, but with a healthy season in the books he will likely be selected in 2014. Wallmark can QB a power play with the best of them, and his patience and vision are distinguishable traits to go along with above-average hands. His soft touch allows him to elevate the puck well as a passer, on top of being able to maneuver well in tight spaces. He's lacking as a defensive presence and skater, but he finds ways to generate scoring chances, and has top-six potential at the NHL level.</p>

<p>John is a second cousin to <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> head coach Joel Quenneville, and the nephew of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/bos/boston-bruins">Boston Bruins</a> defenseman <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/2072/johnny-boychuk">Johnny Boychuk</a> by marriage. He is strong in puck possession, can make quick decisions with the puck, and works hard to get to the net and win battles. Scouts describe him as a very dangerous player from the hashmarks in. John's skating needs some work, as his first few steps aren't the best. He's improved a fair amount defensively and has become a fine penalty killer.</p>
<p><b>43. Oskar Lindblom | LW | Brynas (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 8/15/96 | 2013-14 stats: 43 GP, 13 G, 20 A, 28 PIM</b></p>
<p>Lindblom turned a lot of heads as an under-age player at the 2013 under-17 world championships, when he led the tournament in scoring; bear in mind that this was an event that featured many of this draft class' top prospects. He hasn't lived up to that performance this season, but he remains very intriguing. Lindblom is a strong power winger who gets praise for the tough brand of hockey he brings out of his 6-2, 187-pound frame. He's a solid skater with a fine top gear and he can be a handful for defenders. He's not the most gifted skill guy, with one NHL exec saying, "He's always going to have to find tough ways to score, because he won't beat guys with the puck."</p>
<p><b>44. Emil Johansson | D | HV71 (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 5/6/96 | 2013-14 stats: 42 GP, 2 G, 7 A, 28 PIM</b></p>
<p>Johansson will never stand out in a dynamic way, but he's a "bring your lunchpail" type of player who gets the job done every game. He skates well in terms of both speed and agility, and is a capable defender, despite average size (6-0, 194 pounds). Johansson reads the play at a high level in terms of body and stick positioning, and makes the right decisions off the puck. He's not a great puck handler, but he sees the ice fine and is able to make decent plays offensively due to his hockey IQ.</p>
<p><b>45. Jayce Hawryluk | C | Brandon (WHL)<br>
DOB: 1/1/96 | 2013-14 stats: 59 GP, 24 G, 40 A, 44 PIM</b></p>
<p>Hawryluk has put up a good chunk of points between his 16- and 17-year-old seasons, and was a top scorer for the Wheat Kings this season. He can make plays in open ice, but is more impressive as a passer. Hawryluk's intangibles are more of a standout quality than his skills: He has a great work ethic, and is a strong, physical player. "He protects the puck well, pressures defensemen well, and comes back hard on the back check," said one scout. Hawryluk plays the tough defensive minutes, and projects to be an all-situations player in the NHL. It's unclear whether he has enough offensive skill to be a pro scorer, although he's intriguing in that aspect of the game.</p>
<p><b>46. Ondrej Kase | RW | Chomutov (Czech Extraliga)<br>
DOB: 11/8/95 | 2013-14 stats: 37 GP, 4 G, 3 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>The first time I saw Kase play was at last year's world under-18 championships, and there were at least 10 instances when he made you think, "Hey, who is that guy?" Kase is a skilled player who has the ability to dazzle with his puck skills. On top of his puck creativity, he has good overall offensive instincts and above-average speed, acceleration and edge control. He has a long way to go physically, as he's 6-0, 165 pounds and loses a lot of battles as a result. Kase won't be a team's best all-around player, and won't be killing penalties, but he's certainly adept as a scorer.</p>
<p><b>47. Ben Thomas | D | Calgary (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/28/96 | 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 7 G, 24 A, 39 PIM</b></p>
<p>Thomas isn't great at any one thing, but does a lot at a good level. He's an above-average skater with a nice quick burst that allows him to be active from the blue line. He doesn't have great puck skills, but he has good vision and instincts. Thomas outlets the puck well, has anticipation of when to join the rush and make quick decisions with the puck. He's a pretty hard-working player on defense who will battle and get in front of pucks, but he doesn't land high-impact hits. He's a fine defensive player overall, but can clean up some of his positioning. He doesn't have a high ceiling, but could be a useful pro.</p>
<p><b>48. Ryan Donato | C | Dexter School (U.S. high school)<br>
DOB: 4/9/96 | 2013-14 stats: 30 GP, 37 G, 41 A</b></p>
<p>Donato's offensive instincts are tremendous in terms of his creativity, vision, and positional play, although there is some element of uncertainty given the level of competition against which he played. Donato's an average-sized player (6-0, 176 pounds), who needs to add bulk, but he has two-way value. He's not a slow skater per se, but he's not the quickest guy when you adjust for his size. He has enough talent to potentially be a pro scorer, but he could also be effective playing in a bottom-six role as well. He is committed to playing for his father, former NHLer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/223/ted-donato">Ted Donato</a>, at Harvard University for the 2015-16 season.</p>
<p><b>49. Jack Glover | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/17/96 | 2013-14 stats: 59 GP, 2 G, 26 A, 30 PIM </b></p>
<p>At his best, Glover has the tools to excel at both ends of the rink. He's a good to very good skater, with solid puck skills. At 6-3, 192 pounds, he makes distinct plays for a man his size, and is a player whose ceiling is still being defined. The downside is his decision-making. "He can get caught running around," said one scout. Another scout said, "He's inconsistent; the hockey IQ worries me sometimes." To be fair, Glover has improved immensely on defense; during the latter part of the season, he was one of the best players defensively for the NTDP, logging the tough assignments effectively. But again, he's hard to get a read on, and has some risk-reward elements to his game. He is committed to the University of Minnesota for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>50. Vaclav Karabacek | RW | Gatineau (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 5/2/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 21 G, 26 A, 40 PIM</b></p>
<p>Karabacek has played ahead of his age group for the Czechs in international play, and was in Austria during 2012-13 ahead of his encouraging North American debut in 2013-14. He controls the puck with some flashy skills, and good overall instincts and decision making. His shot has developed well, as he gets the puck off his stick quickly and with accuracy. His size (5-11, 185 pounds) is a limitation, but not to the same degree as some of the other skilled forwards on this list.</p><p></p>

<p>Compared to the much-anticipated 2013 NHL draft class -- a group that featured projected elite talents such as <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041969/nathan-mackinnon">Nathan MacKinnon</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041992/seth-jones">Seth Jones</a> -- this year's prospect pool has been flying a little under the radar. But when you start to put the 2014 crop under the microscope, it's clear that there is still plenty of talent to be harvested.</p>
<p><!-- begin inline 1 --><!-- INLINE MODULE -->
<div class="mod-container mod-no-footer mod-inline content-box floatright mod-no-header-footer">
<div class="mod-content">
<h4>Prospect ranking methodology</h4>
<p>Rankings are based on discussions with scouts on top of video and live viewings, and place a slight emphasis on puck possession, based on studies that show it is the <a href="http://vhockey.blogspot.com/2009/05/possession-is-everything.html" target="new">best predictive measure</a> of team-level success. Performance is a secondary factor, adjusted for age, team strength, league quality and other contextual elements.</p> 
<p>Defensemen are given slightly less value than forwards of equal skill level because of higher projection uncertainty inherent in the position. </p> 
</div>
</div>
<!-- END INLINE MODULE --><!-- end inline 1 --></p>
<p>To put it in perspective, compared to last year's draft class (without our current hindsight), I'd have ranked <strong>Aaron Ekblad</strong> behind MacKinnon and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041971/jonathan-drouin">Jonathan Drouin</a>, with a tough debate about how close he was to Jones and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3042003/valeri-nichushkin">Valeri Nichushkin</a>. He'd have ranked ahead of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3041970/aleksander-barkov">Aleksander Barkov</a>, however. I'd then have <strong>Sam Bennett</strong> and the rest of the top tier after Barkov.</p>
<p>Although the No. 1 and 2 prospects are below-average compared to the players who have fallen in that range historically, the middle of the top end -- the No. 5 to 10 range -- is somewhat <em>above-</em>average. This draft may not be one that produces superstars, but there are some very useful players here.</p>
<p>There is a slight drop-off after Ekblad, and the next tier runs three prospects deep, with another tier from No. 5 to 9. There's a good argument to fit any of the next seven prospects after the No. 9 slot into that group, but the rest of the draft is a gradual decline from there.</p>
<p>The OHL is represented well, with 10 players in the top 30. This is also a strong year for European leagues, particularly the Swedish ones, as for the first time those leagues emerged as the preferred alternative for top non-Swedish prospects overseas. <strong>Kevin Fiala</strong> (Switzerland) as well as <strong>David Pastrnak</strong> and <strong>Jakub Vrana</strong> (Czech Republic) played in Sweden's top leagues and developed well.</p>
<p>It's also a comparatively strong class in terms of netminders, led by <strong>Thatcher Demko</strong>. However, this is a poor year for defensemen. After my No. 1 overall prospect, Ekblad, it's a big drop to <strong>Haydn Fleury</strong> (No. 10), and on the whole, there are only four defensemen in my top 30 skaters.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this is a personal ranking, and I am aware it does not necessarily reflect an industry consensus. For example, it is likely that both <strong>Leon Draisaitl</strong> (No. 7) and <strong>Michael Dal Colle</strong> (No. 8) go in the top five on June 27.</p>
<p>The following players make up numbers 51 through 100 on my list, and I've also included a handful that just missed:</p><p></p>

<p><b>51. Marcus Pettersson | D | Skelleftea (SHL)<br>
DOB: 5/8/96 | 2013-14 stats: 10 GP, 0 G, 0 A, 2 PIM</b></p>
<p>Pettersson recently converted to defense from forward, and there are understandably raw elements in his game due to his transition, but he's also an intriguing player due to his upside and how he's tracking. Pettersson has quick feet, overall good range for a defender and skates very well for a big man (6-foot-3, 161 pounds). His skill and offensive instincts are still evident from his forward days, as he moves the puck well and can join the attack. His defensive sense and reads are a significant work in progress. Pettersson can struggle with gap control and containing the better forwards. Despite being a big guy, he's not the toughest on his checks and needs to work on his strength.</p>
<p><b>52. Alex Peters | D | Plymouth (OHL)<br>
DOB: 7/2/96 | 2013-14 stats: 50 GP, 3 G, 6 A, 44 PIM</b></p>
<p>Alex is the younger brother of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/_/name/car/carolina-hurricanes">Carolina Hurricanes</a> goaltender <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/3229/justin-peters">Justin Peters</a>, and has really grown into his role as a quality shutdown defenseman. Peters is a big defender, standing 6-4 and weighing 205 pounds. He uses his frame well, competing hard in battles and boxing forwards away from the high-percentage areas. Peters is an average skater but fine for his size. He's a pretty aware defensive player, who understands all the things he needs to do to get possession of the puck back. Peters positions himself well in the defensive zone, and doesn't get caught running around. His puck skills are poor, as he can struggle at times handling the puck or moving it up the ice. He shows some competence in that area at the Junior stage, but likely is a replacement-level offensive player as a pro.</p>

<p><b>53. Brendan Lemieux | LW | Barrie-OHL<br>
DOB: 3/15/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 27 G, 26 A, 145 PIM</b></p>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/534/claude-lemieux">Claude Lemieux</a>'s son brings some of the same intangibles and pestering qualities as his father. He's a very strong winger who is physical and intense every shift. Lemieux is an above-average skater, although I've gotten mixed reviews from scouts on that area of his game. Some scouts I've talked to note they aren't crazy about his skating, but every time I've seen him he's looked impressive in that area. Lemieux has good balance and is effective protecting the puck. He isn't an overly skilled player, but he's decent offensively with good instincts. On his best shifts, his hockey IQ shines through, but Lemieux needs to work on reigning in his emotions and not taking bad penalties, which he does often. The apple didn't fall far from the tree on that front. He has the ability to be a scoring, physical winger if he pans out.</p>
<p><b>54. Brycen Martin | D | Swift Current (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/9/96| 2013-14: 72 GP, 6 G, 31 A, 42 PIM</b></p>
<p>Martin is a pretty effective two-way defenseman who isn't the kind of player that stands out in a highlight reel type of way. However, he does a lot of things well. He's a really smart puck mover who plays well under pressure. His first pass and transition game get high praise from NHL sources. Martin is a clear above-average skater with active feet, good four-way movements and nice power in his steps, with solid to above-average puck skills. He's a physical player who leans on his checks and battles well. Martin can be fine in his own end, and while he'll still make the odd mistake typical of players his age, he understands the game defensively.</p>
<p><b>55. Aaron Haydon | D | Niagara (OHL)<br>
DOB: 2/2/96 | 2013-14: 61 GP, 5 G, 11 A, 112 PIM</b></p>
<p>The Plymouth, Michigan native had a fine second OHL season, excelling defensively and getting more offensive responsibility as the season went on. His physical tools are very good and drive his value. Haydon is a 6-3, 200-pound defender who is physical and wins a ton of battles. Haydon regularly landed pretty quality hits. He closes gaps well due to his quality mobility with enough speed to be an asset on the rush. Haydon's decisions in his 16-year-old season were a significant concern, but he's played a style this season that incorporates much less risk and the results have been positive. Haydon handles the puck fine and can deliver an accurate, crisp outlet. His defensive reads are decent, but he can still be turned to the outside or miss his man a little too much. He'll need time, but has upside to be worth waiting on.</p>
<p><b>56. Jack Dougherty, D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/25/96| 2013-14 stats: 55 GP, 6 G, 16 A, 65 PIM</b></p>
<p>Dougherty had a pretty solid first season with the NTDP, entering the program after playing high school hockey. He is a pretty toolsy defender, who stands out offensively. His skating ranges from good to excellent. He moves well in all directions, with nice explosiveness in his first step and overall refined footwork and skating technique. Dougherty is dangerous with the puck as a rusher and distributor. He's got some creativity with the puck in his game and can beat checkers one-on-one. Dougherty is an average-sized player (6-2, 185 pounds), but has some bite to his game. Where he struggles is with his decisions and reads. Dougherty will get beat a little too often, and also give the puck away more than he should. He needs to manage his risk better and pick his spots on when to attack. He is committed to the University of Wisconsin for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>57. Rourke Chartier | C | Kelowna (WHL)<br>
DOB: 4/2/96| 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 24 G, 34 A, 8 PIM</b></p>
<p>Chartier had a very slow start to the season, with just nine points through the first 25 games, but had an outstanding second half. He's been an all-situations player for Kelowna but really impresses in the defensive parts of the game. Chartier is a pretty good skater and can be a nuisance on the forecheck or getting in lanes on the penalty kill. He understands the defensive game very well and with his good faceoff skills, projects as a potential tough minutes player at the NHL level. Chartier's notable weakness is his height, as he stands 5-11.</p>
<p><b>58. Louis Belpedio | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/14/96| 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 7 G, 16 A, 46 PIM</b></p>
<p>Belpedio was a solid two-way defenseman for the NTDP this season and is part of the rare breed of right-handed defenders who play the left side well. Belpedio has pretty quick feet and skates well for a defender, meaning he's mobile going in all directions, has good footwork and can also join the attack. Belpedio may be a bit small (5-11), but he's strong and works hard to win battles. This combined with his very high hockey IQ makes him a good penalty killer, and he logged some tough minutes for the NTDP. He is committed to the University of Miami (Ohio) for the 2015-16 season.</p>
<p><b>59. Clark Bishop | C | Cape Breton (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 3/29/96| 2013-14 stats: 56 GP, 14 G, 19 A, 54 PIM</b></p>
<p>Bishop was the No. 3 overall pick in the 2012 QMJHL draft, and while he hasn't put up great stats, there are a lot of appealing attributes to his game. He's an above-average to plus skater who gets up and down the ice well due to a great natural stride on top of an elite work ethic. The "Go" switch is always turned on with Bishop. The issue with Bishop is how much offense he ultimately will produce. A minority of scouts feel he will score in the NHL, but most see him as a third-line player, due to average puck skills and below-average finishing ability.</p>
<p><b>60. William Lagesson | D | Frolunda (J20SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 2/22/96 | 2013-14 stats: 44 GP, 8 G, 12 A, 30 PIM</b></p>
<p>If you quickly look up Lagesson's numbers, they aren't all that impressive. Despite his low point totals, he's an impressive overall player who was very solid representing Sweden at the international level. Lagesson stands in at 6-2, 196 pounds, and thinks the game very well in his own end. He's always getting his stick on pucks, is in the right position to angle his man off and anticipates offensive pressure well. Lagesson also excels on the penalty kill due to these attributes. His passing is solid, and while Lagesson doesn't look like a player who will get much power play time at the pro level, he's a calm, smooth puck mover who can aid in the transition game.</p>
<p><b>61. Joshua Jacobs | D | Indiana (USHL)<br>
DOB: 2/15/96 | 2013-14 stats: 56 GP, 5 G, 18 A, 46 PIM</b></p>
<p>Jacobs is a player about whom I get mixed feelings when I talk to USHL scouts. He was a USHL All-Star this season, and one of the few under-18s for USA at the World Jr. A Challenge. "He's a tremendous athlete," said one scout. Jacobs is an above-average if not a high-end skater who can lead rushes and is mobile in all directions, and also has a good frame and doesn't shy away from the physical parts of the game. While Jacobs has good flashes of defensive value in the USHL, there are concerns about his defense going forward. His hockey sense is below-average, regularly making bad decisions with the puck or missing assignments. He is committed to Michigan State for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>62. Alexis Vanier | D | Baie-Comeau (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 12/21/95 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 15 G, 21 A, 52 PIM</b></p>
<p>Vanier was fine as a 17-year-old, but he showed significant growth in his second QMJHL season. He's a giant on the ice at 6-5, 225 pounds, and on top of that he throws the body around regularly. Vanier is obviously an elite physical player at the junior level, and projects to be the same as a pro. He also has the capability to get his entire frame into a bomb of a shot, which makes him quite dangerous on the power play. His skating is a weakness, as his turns are a little awkward, and while he has a great wingspan, he can still be beat wide.</p>
<p><b>63. Ryan MacInnis | C | Kitchener (OHL)<br>
DOB: 2/14/96 | 2013-14 stats: 66 GP, 16 G, 21 A, 18 PIM</b></p>
<p>The son of Hall of Famer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/554/al-macinnis">Al MacInnis</a> is a big, skilled center who will need several years to develop. However, he has significant potential. MacInnis is a 6-4 playmaker who, at the junior level, is tough to get off of the puck. He's a really smart player who makes plays under pressure, can see the ice even when he's not looking down his options, and understands positional hockey at an advanced level in every zone. MacInnis needs to work on his skating, as he's got a bit of an awkward stride and is not the best in the speed department. His shot also has some room for improvement, which may surprise some, considering his father's legendary work in that department.</p>

<p><b>64. Chase De Leo | C | Portland (WHL)<br>
DOB: 10/25/95 | 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 39 G, 42 A, 36 PIM</b></p>
<p>De Leo has been a tough guy to evaluate the past two seasons, due to being low on the depth chart on stacked offensive teams. He's a pretty talented player in his own right, but not along the lines of players who have been drafted high out of Portland recently (<a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5434/ryan-johansen">Ryan Johansen</a>, Seth Jones and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/player/_/id/5511/nino-niederreiter">Nino Niederreiter</a> among them). He's certainly an above-average skater and flashes beyond that. When you combine his shifty skating with his good puck skills, it makes him a pretty tough player to check. De Leo's size isn't ideal at around 5-9, but he works hard on both ends. He won't be an overly physical forward or great defensively, but he shows effort in those areas and can be moderately effective.</p>
<p><b>65. Aaron Irving | D | Edmonton (WHL)<br>
DOB: 3/13/96 | 2013-14 stats: 63 GP, 9 G, 21 A, 88 PIM</b></p>
<p>In his first full WHL season, Irving took substantial steps forward after coming in as a possible late-round pick. He has average size (6-1, 190 pounds), but he is really tough to play against. He's strong in one-on-one battles, often coming out with the puck. Irving gets in lanes, gets his stick in the right spot, plays simple positional hockey and makes good outlets. He's not an overwhelming offensive talent, but has some ability with the puck and a big shot from the point. Irving's skating can stand to improve as he can be beat wide.</p>
<p><b>66. Maxim Letunov | C | Youngstown (USHL)<br>
DOB: 2/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 60 GP, 19 G, 24 A, 42 PIM</b></p>
<p>Letunov has one of the more fascinating development paths you'll see. Born in Moscow, he came to the United States and played his midget-level hockey in Dallas before heading to Ohio to play junior, and is committed to Boston University for the 2014-15 season. Scouts commonly describe Letunov as a dynamic forward whose puck skills and offensive creativity are high-end. He has the ability to make unique plays with the puck and creates a large amount of chances. His skating is subpar, however, with several NHL scouts pointing to a severe lack of lower-body strength and a wonky stride. His overall physical game is also poor despite a good work ethic, and at 6-2, 155 pounds, he's a bit of a string bean.</p>
<p><b>67. Brandon Fortunato | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 6/7/96 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 3 G, 34 A, 14 PIM</b></p>
<p>Fortunato was the top scoring defenseman on the NTDP this season, and his production is a reflection of his offensive talent. Fortunato is an excellent skater who accelerates at a high-end level, is quick in every direction and very tough to check or pressure on the forecheck due to skating ability. Fortunato is also a skilled puck handler and puck mover, who leads a power play very well. His size is his biggest issue, as he's a pretty small defenseman (5-10, 148 pounds) who isn't the best in one-on-one battles. Fortunato is solid in terms of defensive reads, but as of now his defensive value is a significant question mark due to his size and lack of standout defensive sense. He is committed to Boston University for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>68. Miles Gendron | D | The Rivers School (US high school)<br>
DOB: 6/28/96 | 2013-14 stats: 22 GP, 6 G, 13 A</b></p>
<p>Gendron is described by scouts as a high-tools type of prospect who is raw. The latter part stems from the recent change from forward to defense on top of lack of playing time versus quality opponents. "He's an elite skater" said one NHL scout, as Gendron has the first few step bursts and overall top gear to be a dangerous puck rusher. He has good upside, but a team drafting Gendron has to understand the risks. He still has a ways to go in learning the position, in terms of reads and improving his physical play. Gendron has decent size (6-2, 172 pounds), but could stand to bulk up more.</p>
<p><b>69. Brett Pollock | C | Edmonton (WHL)<br>
DOB: 3/16/96 | 2013-14 stats: 71 GP, 25 G, 30 A, 36 PIM</b></p>
<p>After notching just 15 points in his first 55 WHL games (40 in 2012-13, 15 in 2013-14), a switch flipped midseason, and he had 45 points in 40 games from November to the end of the season. Pollock has above-average puck skills with impressive coordination and ability to maintain possession. He's not a blazing skater, but he has a good top gear with decent first steps. Pollock can really lean into his shots as well. Despite his size (6-2, 183 pounds), Pollock is a bit of a gentle player when it comes to physical play. Pollock's overall defensive work needs to pick up as well.</p>
<p><b>70. Andreas Englund | D | Djurgarden (Allsvenskan)<br>
DOB: 1/21/96 | 2013-14 stats: 19 GP, 1 G, 1 A, 14 PIM</b></p>
<p>Englund spent some time in both the junior and professional ranks this season, playing very well in the second half and was good for Sweden at the international under-18 level as well. He's physically intriguing at 6-3, 190 pounds, especially when considering he uses his body well to win puck battles, and at times land some crushing physical blows. He's certainly a quality penalty killer who can make stops, and at even strength his sense allows him to check tougher players. Englund's puck moving is decent, but he'll never be confused for a puck wizard.</p>
<p><b>71. Nick Magyar | RW | Kitchener (OHL)<br>
DOB: 5/29/96 | 2013-14 stats: 66 GP, 20 G, 26 A, 20 PIM</b></p>
<p>Magyar was one of the top rookies in the OHL this season, leading the Kitchener Rangers in scoring. He's an average-sized forward who is strong on the puck, with a good work ethic. He shows flashes of being a creative player with the puck, although that part of his game isn't too consistent. Magyar skates well and is dangerous in transition on top of having an impressive shot. His work ethic makes him a decent penalty killer, although he'll still need to work on his positioning off the puck.</p>
<p><b>72. Ryan Hitchcock | LW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 3/30/96 | 2013-14 stats: 53 GP, 12 G, 37 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>Hitchcock is a pretty good all-around forward, who was up around a point per game for the NTDP this season. Hitchcock plays the game with speed and energy and is very dangerous taking the puck through the neutral zone due to his skating ability. He can kill penalties effectively, and is good at pressuring opposing players. Hitchcock is a smaller player at 5-10, and the biggest question is what role he'll play as a pro. Is he skilled enough to score, and if not, is he big enough to check? There's enough talent with Ryan in all areas of the game that it's worth gambling on him should he improve in any one area. He's committed to Yale University for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>73. Ryan Collins | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 5/6/96 | 2013-14 stats: 59 GP, 1 G, 6 A, 26 PIM</b></p>
<p>Collins is a monster of a man at 6-5, 200 pounds, who has some intriguing tools for a big man. He's an above-average skater for a player his size, and can evade pressure fine. He's a very heady defenseman who scouts praise for his cool demeanor and overall reads defensively. He has certain smoothness about the simple, effective way he plays. He also uses his big frame well to win battles and knock players off pucks. His obvious flaw is offensive skill; while he has decent poise with the puck, he can look a little clumsy and doesn't generate a ton of offensive creativity. He's committed to the University of Minnesota for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>74. Jake Walman | D | Toronto Jr. Canadiens (OJHL)<br>
DOB: 2/20/96 | 2013-14 stats: 43 GP, 7 G, 26 A, 97 PIM</b></p>
<p>Walman is the top prospect in Canada's junior-A tier. He recently changed positions from forward to defense, and that position change has done a lot for him as a prospect. "He's a pure athlete," said one scout of Walman. He's an explosive skater who gets out of the gates really well, and for a recent convert to defense, his backward skating and pivots are exceptional. Walman is slightly below-average size-wise and needs bulk, but when I've watched him in small samples I've liked what I've seen from him physically in terms of hits and battles. However, scouts who have seen him more extensively have criticized that area of his game. Walman is a pretty skilled puck mover with a big shot who has all the tools to be a big-time offensive player. His defense needs a lot of work though, understandably, and his decisions aren't always the best. He is committed to Providence College for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>75. Dysin Mayo | D | Edmonton (WHL)<br>
DOB: 8/17/96 | 2013-14 stats: 63 GP, 7 G, 28 A, 50 PIM</b></p>
<p>Mayo saw a big spike in scoring this season as he was part of a strong Oil Kings defensive group. Mayo is a strong skater with the speed and bursts to lead the attack effectively. His skill set doesn't really stand out in a major way, though, and I'm unsure exactly what type of role he would have as a pro. But there's enough to his game in many areas to make him worth a mid-round selection.</p>
<p><b>76. Matthew Berkovitz | D | Ashwaubenon (US high school)<br>
DOB: 2/16/96 | 2013-14 stats: 24 GP, 11 G, 26 A, 12 PIM</b></p>
<p>Berkovitz is the rare top prospect to come out of the Wisconsin high school ranks. He's a pretty gifted player on a tools level. He's a good puck mover from the back end, who displays the vision and overall instincts to be an effective player with his outlets, rushes and when he gets his power-play time. Scouts note that his hockey sense does stand out, but the main issue with Berkovitz is the level of competition he's faced and trying to evaluate him there. He's committed to the University of Wisconsin for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>77. Blake Siebenaler | D | Niagara (OHL)<br>
DOB: 2/27/96 | 2013-14 stats: 68 GP, 6 G, 24 A, 24 PIM</b></p>
<p>Siebenaler had a good first season in the OHL, and is one of the better pure skaters in his draft class. His ability to escape pressure, rush through the zone and burst well in all directions makes him an appealing prospect. Siebenaler's upside is what you dream on, because for now he's a bit of a work in progress defensively. He's raw for the OHL level in his own end in terms of the physicality required and his overall defensive reads, although his strength level is decent.</p>
<p><b>78. Gustav Forsling | D | Linkoping (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 6/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 44 GP, 6 G, 12 A, 36 PIM</b></p>
<p>Forsling is a toolsy offensive defenseman who impressed in league play during the second half of the season. He excels controlling the flow on the power play. He's a smart and creative player, but also knows how to make the safe plays. His defense has improved notably, however he can still be turned or beaten by better forwards.</p>
<p><b>79. Nicolas Aube-Kubel | RW | Val-d'Or (QMJHL)<br>
DOB: 5/10/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 22 G, 31 A, 61 PIM</b></p>
<p>Aube-Kubel was a top pick in the 2012 QMJHL draft that has played well, but still has more potential than what he's shown so far. He's a really gifted puck handler who on his best game creates chances out of nothing and can be dangerous in open ice. He's not a fantastic skater, but he has a fine top gear and good agility. He also has an impressive shot. Aube-Kubel isn't the best off the puck though, as he can struggle a bit with his reads on both ends. The majority view is that his defensive play and consistency are both knocks on his game, although one scout I talked to did praise his defense.</p>
<p><b>80. Jonathan MacLeod | D | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 6/2/96 | 2013-14 stats: 51 GP, 5 G, 6 A, 70 PIM</b></p>
<p>MacLeod is not a really flashy defenseman but he provided a steady, consistent shift in the NTDP lineup this season. He can land quality hits, and is effective battling for pucks. His hockey IQ is exceptional, as he possesses a calm demeanor in regards to how he goes about the game. While MacLeod probably won't be an NHL power-play guy, he demonstrates great puck-moving ability, flashes of good offensive IQ and an accurate shot through traffic. He is committed to Boston University for the 2015-16 season.</p>
<p><b>81. Warren Foegele | LW | St. Andrews (CAN high school)<br>
DOB: 4/1/96 | 2013-14 stats: 52 GP, 58 G, 49 A, 67 PIM</b></p>
<p>Foegele was around a two points-per-game player (in a weak league, mind you) this season, but despite those numbers he doesn't really project as an offensive scorer in the big leagues. "He's not really creative and lacks touch," said one scout. Rather, Foegele is more of your standard heart-and-soul type of forward, with some puck ability. Foegele is a nonstop engine during every shift, who battles hard at all ends of the ice. He attacks the high percentage areas and has an attitude that can make him a fan favorite. He's committed to the University of New Hampshire for the 2014-15 season.</p>

DOB: 1/2/96 | 2013-14 stats: 65 GP, 2 G, 21 A, 64 PIM</b></p>
<p>Middleton has been a top prospect for a few seasons. He was drafted eighth overall in the 2012 OHL draft, and was very impressive as a 16-year-old in the OHL and at the under-17 world challenge competition. He didn't have a great 17-year-old season, but there's still a lot of reason for optimism with Middleton. He's big, developed physically for his size (6-2, 207 pounds), and does a lot physically in terms of winning battles and boxing out forwards. Middleton is not just a bruiser though, as he's an aware positional defender who makes a lot of stops. His puck skills aren't the best, and Middleton hasn't been the most consistent player, although being on a bad team may have made him seem worse than he is.</p>
<p><b>83. Andrei Mironov | D | Dynamo Moscow (KHL)<br>
DOB: 7/29/94 | 2013-14 stats: 46 GP, 3 G, 7 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>After going undrafted twice, I'm skeptical that the third time will be a charm for Mironov, but he's a player who has grown on me from his time internationally and in the KHL. Mironov is a fine two-way defender, whose value is likely tilted toward the defensive end. His off-puck positioning is solid, and overall he displays above-average defensive reads in terms of anticipating the flow, getting in lanes and stopping rushes. Mironov won't be a team's best offensive player, but he's a good enough skater to join the rush and offensively.</p>
<p><b>84. Michael Bunting | LW | Sault Ste. Marie (OHL)<br>
DOB: 9/17/95 | 2013-14 stats: 48 GP, 15 G, 27 A, 34 PIM</b></p>
<p>Bunting is one of the more interesting stories among the prospects in my top three rounds. At 17 years old this past season, Bunting was playing at the midget AAA level, and nowhere near the NHL radar. The progress he has made in such a short amount of time is telling to why many rave about his character. He possesses a high level of skill, and has the coordination to make tough plays with the puck. At his best, he can be an offensive force, but he's a pretty raw player due to the lack of high-level play. Bunting is a high-risk, high-reward pick in the middle rounds.</p>
<p><b>85. Reid Gardiner | C | Prince Albert (WHL)<br>
DOB: 1/19/96 | 2013-14 stats: 70 GP, 22 G, 22 A, 39 PIM</b></p>
<p>Gardiner was a top prospect coming up through the bantam-level ranks, and while he hasn't flourished as a top-end WHL player, he's pretty gifted. "He thinks the game well offensively and makes quick decisions," said one scout. Gardiner is below-average in size (5-11, 185 pounds), but he's got a fine strength level already, and wins a good chunk of battles. He also is able to score from mid distance due to a nice wrist shot. Scouts I've talked to like his defensive play and his work off the puck, but from what I've seen I believe those areas could use work.</p>
<p><b>86. Anders Bjork | RW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 8/5/96 | 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 21 G, 21 A, 10 PIM</b></p>
<p>The Wisconsin native is a versatile forward who had a quality season with the NTDP. He's a quick, agile skater and when combined with his puck skills, Bjork can be tough to check. Bjork is a hard-working forward who can kill penalties at an OK level, and understands how to position himself off the puck. He's committed to Notre Dame for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>87. Brandon Hickey | D | Spruce Grove (AJHL)<br>
DOB: 4/13/96 | 2013-14 stats: 37 GP, 4 G, 12, 22 PIM</b></p>
<p>Hickey hasn't put up great numbers this season, but scouts I've talked to have consistently raved about him on a tools level. He's a plus skater with explosive movements in all four directions. He's a smart two-way player who can outlet the puck at a high level. Hickey has some creativity to his game, though scouts think he has more to show in that area. One scout said, "He has the offensive tools, but he can be too conservative at times. He needs to be more offensive oriented, take more chances." Scouts are also divided on his physicality. He's committed to Boston University for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>88. Luc Snuggerud | D | Eden Prairie (U.S. high school)<br>
DOB: 9/18/95 | 2013-14 stats: 25 GP, 8 G, 30 A, 19 PIM</b></p>
<p>Snuggerud is the top high school prospect to come out of the Minnesota ranks this season. He's a high-end skater who is described as "explosive" by scouts, due to how well he rushes up the ice and can lead the offensive charge. He's also a very mobile all-directions player who stays with the fastest forwards effectively. He has a fine shot, and gets the puck through lanes well. He has a few flaws, though. Luc is a tad small (5-11, 165 pounds), and doesn't project as a great physical player. His reads can be off a little too often in terms of risk-taking and not playing at the ideal pace. He is committed to the University of Nebraska-Omaha for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>89. Juho Lammikko | RW | Assat (Liiga)<br>
DOB: 1/29/96 | 2013-14 stats: 20 GP, 0 G, 1 A, 0 PIM</b></p>
<p>Lammikko had a decent season, where he impressed in International competition, and while he got 20 games in Finland's top pro league, he notched only one point. Juho has an intriguing tool kit as he's a big forward (6-3, 189 pounds) who is strong on the puck. He also has good offensive tools as an above-average puck handler with offensive creativity. He plays strategically at both ends, although as always with young players, a little tweaking in his D positioning could help. Skating is the most notable area of weakness for Lammikko, as he's not the quickest out of the gates.</p>
<p><b>90. Nelson Nogier | D | Saskatoon (WHL)<br>
DOB: 5/27/96 | 2013-14 stats: 37 GP, 1 G, 5 A, 25 PIM</b></p>
<p>Nogier's stats aren't the prettiest, as he's not a points producer and he missed a good chunk of this season due to a shoulder injury. However, it's his the combination of skating and size (6-2, 192 pounds) that makes him an appealing prospect. He makes stops by getting in shot and passing lanes, but also stays with his checks well and has fine overall positioning. He isn't an overly physical player, but he will use his body when needed and battles fine. His main weakness is evident; his offensive capabilities are next to nothing. Nogier will provide a decent outlet pass, but that's the extent of his puck skills.</p>
<p><b>91. Julius Bergman | D | Frolunda (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 11/2/95 | 2013-14 stats: 45 GP, 13 G, 21 A, 54 PIM</b></p>
<p>Bergman is average in size (6-1, 196 pounds), but has fine physical value because he plays hard and wins battles. Bergman plays a smart, steady defensive game with his positioning and overall reads, and his potential value will be as a penalty-killing defenseman who plays against talented players. He's not the most skilled puck handler in the world, and won't project onto an NHL power play, but has enough vision and offensive IQ to outlet and escape pressure.</p>
<p><b>92. Nikita Tryamkin | D | Yekaterinburg (KHL)<br>
DOB: 8/30/94 | 2013-14 stats: 45 GP, 1 G, 6 A, 38 PIM</b></p>
<p>Tryamkin had a breakout season as a 19-year-old, following a somewhat typical delayed development path. Tryamkin's size is his clear best asset -- he's 6-7, 228 pounds, and skates and handles the puck well for a big man. Tryamkin doesn't have fantastic puck skills, but he did fine on Russia's second PP unit at the World Junior Championship, and has solid projection offensively.</p>
<p><b>93. Reid Duke | C | Lethbridge (WHL)<br>
DOB: 1/28/96 | 2013-14 stats: 62 GP, 15 G, 25 A, 91 PIM</b></p>
<p>Duke was among Lethbridge's top scorers on what's been a poor team of late. He's a former top-five WHL draft pick with a lot of promise if he puts it all together; a highly talented forward with the offensive IQ, hand-eye ability and creativity to make distinct plays with the puck. Duke has to round out his game, though. In addition to overcoming less than ideal size (6-0, 187 pounds), scouts also note that he needs to work on his consistency. He could be a decent mid-to-late round pick.</p>
<p><b>94. Adam Olas Mattson | D | Djurgarden (J20 SuperElit)<br>
DOB: 7/30/96| 2013-14 stats: 33 GP, 1 G, 8 A, 42 PIM</b></p>
<p>I heard mixed reports about Olas Mattson's play this season, as can be expected of a pretty gifted athlete who still has some things to improve. Olas Mattson is huge -- 6-4, 209 pounds -- and has fine mobility for a player his size. He's a solid defender who uses his body very well to separate players off pucks and win battles. His positioning is mostly fine, but he can suffer from the odd brain cramp in the defensive zone. His main weakness is with the puck, as he's pretty limited from puck skills standpoint.</p>
<p><b>95. Jaedon Descheneau | RW | Kootenay (WHL)<br>
DOB: 2/22/95 | 2013-14 stats: 70 GP, 44 G, 54 A, 54 PIM</b></p>
<p>Deschenau was passed over in last year's draft, but with more eyes on him due to Sam Reinhart attracting scouts to Kootenay's games -- and continued high-level performance -- he may be selected this time around. Descheneau is a highly talented little guy (5-9, 185 pounds) who has put up big numbers in the WHL, although given his age it's slightly less impressive. His hockey sense is exceptional. He really understands how to make plays to avoid defenders and create chances through his vision and plus puck skills. His speed isn't fantastic, which isn't ideal for a small player. The main issue with Descheneau is clearly his frame. When you're under 5-10, you need to blow people away offensively, and currently, Descheneau is on the fringe.</p>
<p><b>96. Alex Lintuniemi | D | Ottawa (OHL)<br>
DOB: 9/23/95 | 2013-14 stats: 68 GP, 4 G, 17 A, 26 PIM</b></p>
<p>I really liked Lintuniemi as a 17-year-old, and while he struggled initially in his 18-year-old season adjusting to North America, I still think he's a good prospect with a chance to get better. Lintuniemi uses his 6-3, 227-pound body well to win battles and regain puck possession. He had some issues defensively in the OHL, but I do think he has solid defensive projection as a physical, aware defender. He needs to work on his skating, and can make some bad decisions, but those can be corrected by the right NHL program.</p>
<p><b>97. Tanner MacMaster | C | Camrose (AJHL)<br>
DOB: 1/8/96 | 2013-14 stats: 48 GP, 11 G, 29 A, 62 PIM</b></p>
<p>MacMaster didn't have as strong a statistical season as hoped, but scouts aren't too worried, with one saying, "If he had better finishers, his points totals would've been better. He created chances but nobody would score." Tanner is a playmaker; he excels with the puck on his stick and in his best games, he can be a plus puck possessor. He's pretty small (5-10, 157 pounds), but works hard in battles and jetting up and down the ice. He has nice bursts in his step and good overall energy in his game. He's committed to Quinnipiac for the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p><b>98. Dominik Masin | D | HC Slavia Praha (Czech under-20)<br>
DOB: 2/1/96 | 2013-14 stats: 39 GP, 2 G, 19 A, 102 PIM</b></p>
<p>Masin is a strong two-way defenseman who has impressed at the international level, and was decent in league play, although he was his league's most penalized player. Masin is a heady defender who understands how to position himself on the ice, and anticipates the play well. His stick skills are decent, and his skating is about average as well.</p>
<p><b>99. Ivan Nikolishin | C | Everett (WHL)<br>
DOB: 4/12/96 | 2013-14 stats: 72 GP, 18 G, 41 A, 16 PIM</b></p>
<p>Nikolishin didn't have an outstanding season in his first campaign in North America, but he was still a pretty productive player, and one of the top scoring first-year draft-eligible forwards. His skill level is extremely impressive: Nikolishin has high-end hands and can dangle in a phone booth with his coordination. He understands how to create offensively with his natural offensive gifts, combined with above-average vision. He excels quarterbacking the power play. His major drawback is his size (around 5-9, 161 pounds) and being underdeveloped in terms of strength. He's a bit of a project or long shot, but has the tools to score if things panned out.</p>
<p><b>100. Shane Gersich | LW | USNTDP (USHL)<br>
DOB: 7/10/96| 2013-14 stats: 61 GP, 16 G, 16 A, 18 PIM</b></p>
<p>Gersich is one of the better skaters in this draft, and while he's not an overly skilled player, his skating and intangibles make him an intriguing prospect. Gersich can be effective offensively because of how well he gains the zone. He speeds equally as fast on the back check, and fights for loose pucks. He can certainly make some plays offensively in open ice, although he's more of a secondary option.</p><p></p>
