#ranking-the-rankers

General idea:
- Listing career Point Shares/60 minutes played (PS/60) beside each player in each draft list (i.e. actual nhl draft, Corey Pronman's rankings, Craig Button's rankings, etc.)
- Assigning a draft-inclusive rank to each PS/60 (i.e. best PS/60 -> #1, worst PS/60 -> #210)
- Whoever has the closest list to a sequential order (1-30) is the winner
