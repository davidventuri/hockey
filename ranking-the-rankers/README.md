“Ranking the Rankers” is a 7-piece series that quantifies past NHL draft rankings from various prognosticators based on player performance to date.

Part 2: Team Scouts & GMs
Part 3: Bob McKenzie (TSN)
Part 4: Corey Pronman (ESPN Insider)
Part 5: International Scouting Services (ISS Hockey)
Part 6: Craig Button (TSN)
Part 7: Conclusion
Part 1: Introduction
Your favourite hockey team just drafted a teenager. He, presumably, is good at hockey. How can you be sure? Because this set of draft rankings from [insert writer / scout / website here] says so.

There is no shortage of NHL draft rankings. Bob McKenzie, Corey Pronman, International Scouting Services (ISS Hockey), and Craig Button, among several others, put out carefully curated prospect lists year after year. Their lists vary. Their lists are criticized because they vary (some more than others). The draft passes and there isn’t much analysis of who ranked well, qualitative or quantitative. The public’s perception of NHL draft rankings is coloured with bias because of the above cycle.

This series attempts to determine which of the above sets of draft rankings is best at predicting future NHL success (and which one you should hope your team follows on draft day).
